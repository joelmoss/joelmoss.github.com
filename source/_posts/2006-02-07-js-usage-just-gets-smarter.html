It's amazing what you never knew you could do with Javascript isn't it? I mean, all this functionality has been around for years and anyone could have done it, but only now are we really getting into the real meat and potatoes of javascript and what it really is capable of.

<a href="http://www.agilepartners.com/blog/2005/12/07/iphoto-image-resizing-using-javascript/">This article</a> demonstrates a very cool method of resizing images the iPhoto way, but using only <a href="http://prototype.conio.net/">Prototype</a> and <a href="http://script.aculo.us/">Scriptaculous</a>. A simple slider above a group of images allows you to resize the images in one mouse move.

I learn something new everyday and that is why I love it so much :)
