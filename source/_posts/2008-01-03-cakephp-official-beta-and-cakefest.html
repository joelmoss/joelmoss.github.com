<p>So it finally happenned! After a year of development, today marks the release of the very first Beta of CakePHP 1.2. While it is great to see, I just can't help thinking how many beta's we will have to endure before we see a final production release.</p>

<p>Also in the news, is the announcement that Florida will be hosting the first CakePHP conference. <a href="http://www.cakefest.org">CakeFest</a> will take place over three days between February 6th and 8th 2008, and will feature "tutorials, talks, and fun". It sounds so good, I decided to take a shot at submitting a proposal to speak. My subject is obviously about Migrations, so who knows? It would be quite cool to be accepted.</p>

<p>I'll keep ya posted.</p>
