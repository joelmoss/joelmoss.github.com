<p>The start of something new; something cool and something (hopefully) refreshing. This is my first post in my Blog, and I suppose it should be the introduction to &ldquo;The Meaning of Life, the Internet and Everything&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>So why call it that?</strong>
It pretty much covers everything that I want this Blog to be about. I also think it sounds pretty cool; long but cool. - hey, no-ones perfect. Mostly it will contain news, articles and info about the web; anything from Ajax to Hosting.</p>

<p><strong>Who are you?</strong>
My name is Joel Moss and I am the CEO of <a href="http://homepageuniverse.com/ref/joelmoss.info">HomepageUniverse</a>, a well established hosting and internet services company located in Chorley, England. I have been active on the net and with computers for a good nine years or so now, and projects have come and gone, ideas have gestated and died, but HPU has always been there for me.</p>

<p>I am 29 (only just) and am happily married to Faith, with whom I have 3 gorgeous kids; Ashley (8), Elijah (2) and Eve (10 months). My life involves family and work and that suits me just fine, as I enjoy both.</p>

<p><strong>So why are you publishing a blog?</strong>
Why the hell not? Everyone else is, and besides I thought it was high time I gave something back to the community at large and share with you all my knowledge, ideas and personality (watch out!).</p>

<p>So all I can say now, is watch out for lots of posts and enjoy!!</p>
