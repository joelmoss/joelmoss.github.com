The guys over at <a href="http://www.37signals.com/">37Signals</a> really are doing something right. Not content with launching a <a href="http://rubyonrails.com/">masively popular open-source web application framework</a>, aswell as five of the web's most popular Web2.0 applications; they have now decided to let us all in on the act and have written a book on how they do it.

<a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/">Getting Real: The smarter, faster, easier way to build a successful web application</a>; is a 171 page PDF book, detailing "the business, design, programming, and marketing principles of 37signals. The book is packed with keep-it-simple insights, contrarian points of view, and unconventional approaches to software design. This is not a technical book or a design tutorial, it's a book of ideas."

So who am I to knock the in crowd away! I'm about to buy a copy. Keep it here for a review and evidence that your $19 well earned dollars will be put to good use.
