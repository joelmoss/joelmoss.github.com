categories: articles

If you haven't already read, Gwoo has just made an <a href="http://bakery.cakephp.org/articles/view/after-3-years-looking-back-and-moving-ahead">official announcement</a> on the state of the CakePHP project and when we can expect a 1.2 final release.

As mentioned in <a href="http://developingwithstyle.com/articles/2008/04/20/cakephp-goes-on-the-offensive.html">my last post</a>, the management has changed slightly:

<blockquote>The evolving team will still include the core team, with me as Project Manager helping to usher in new developers and provide opportunity for more people to get involved, PhpNut acting in an advisor's role, ensuring that the right code gets implemented and more people learn the magic of CakePHP, Nate taking the lead role in the implementation of the core code, and John continuing to lead the documentation efforts.</blockquote>

So things are looking very promising in terms of a 1.2 release happening within a matter of weeks.

But the best thing about this announcement, is that I am now <a href="https://trac.cakephp.org/wiki/Contributors">listed as an official contributor</a> to the core framework. So expect some code from people!
