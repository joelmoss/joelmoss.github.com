<a href="http://particletree.com/features/lightbox-gone-wild/">This</a> is exactly what I have been looking for while developing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Page_Application">Single Page Interface (SPI)</a> of the new PXP system at <a href="http://homepageuniverse.com/ref/joelmoss.info">HomepageUniverse</a>.
<blockquote>In user interface design, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_window">modal window</a> (sometimes referred to as a modal dialog) is a window that blocks input to other windows. It has to be closed before the user can continue to operate the application and are frequently an element of Multiple Document Interface (MDI) applications or desktop applications like Windows or OS X. One of their purposes is to prevent the software from being operated in an ambiguous state.</blockquote>
I needed such a feature to popup quick info and forms, that didn't warrant the need for a new page. A great way of doing it.

Take a look at <a href="http://particletree.com/features/lightbox-gone-wild/">how it's done</a>.
