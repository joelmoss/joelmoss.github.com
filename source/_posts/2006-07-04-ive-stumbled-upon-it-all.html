<p>Found a lost <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/07/03/the-supernova-12/">article</a> on Techcrunch just a few minutes ago about 12 up and coming web 2.0 startups. A few interesting ones, but one that caught my eye was a community driven site that pushes sites to you based on your interests. <a href="http://stumbleupon.com/">StumbleUpon</a>&nbsp;uses a browser toolbar (currently only available for Firefox) to show you new and interesting sites. Simply click the Stumble button and it takes you to a site that should excite you a little.</p>

<p>I love it! I just can&rsquo;t stop clicking that little button. And most of the sites it shows me have been exactly what I am interested in, so I clicked the &ldquo;I like it&rdquo; button on the sites I like, which then added it to my <a href="http://joelmoss.stumbleupon.com/">fave pages</a> found using StumbleUpon.</p>

<p>I can then even add this list to my Blog of feed reader using the supplied RSS feeds.</p>

<p>You really gotta admire the simplicity of this model and it just makes me wish that I had thought of it first.</p>
