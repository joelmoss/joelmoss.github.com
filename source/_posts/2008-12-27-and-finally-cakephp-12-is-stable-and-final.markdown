Just a quick one, as I am sure that you have already <a href="http://bakery.cakephp.org/articles/view/the-gift-of-1-2-final">read</a>, but I am extremely pleased to tell you all that CakePHP has been released as a final and stable release. This means no more alpha's, beta's or release candidates. <a href="http://cakephp.org">Get it while it is hot</a>, as it is very HOT!

Big congrats go to Nate, Gwoo and all the core team. Well done guys! On to 1.3...
