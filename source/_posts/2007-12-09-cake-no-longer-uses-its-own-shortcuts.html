title: Cake no longer uses its own shortcuts

<p>Well it appears that Cake no longer uses its own function shortcuts within the core. As of <a href="https://trac.cakephp.org/changeset/6128">changeset 6128</a> all usage of the good old low/up, am, r and friends, are no longer used within the core. However, these functions still exist for you to use in your own code.</p>

<p>So the question I ask is; why are these functions no longer good enough for the core? Are they soon to be deprecated? (I hope not).</p>

<p>It's an interesting move nevertheless.</p>
