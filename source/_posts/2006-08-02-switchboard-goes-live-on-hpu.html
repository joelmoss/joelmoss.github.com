<p>The very first release of Switchboard can now be seen in use at <a href="http://switchboard.homepageuniverse.com">http://switchboard.homepageuniverse.com</a></p>

<p>The HPU:Community will be the exclusive user of Switchboard until the public beta begins later this month (August), and will enable us to run some real world testing and perhaps gauge a little interest and feedback.</p>

<p>We will also be launching the new Tooum.com site in a few days, which will include all the details about Tooum and Switchboard, aswell as a full public demo of Switchboard.</p>

<p>So take a sneak peek now &ndash; <a href="http://switchboard.homepageuniverse.com/">http://switchboard.homepageuniverse.com</a></p>
