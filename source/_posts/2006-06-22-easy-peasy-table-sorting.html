I love it when all you need to to acheive something, is to simply drop in a couple of javascript files and add a class name to an element. With the <a href="http://www.workingwith.me.uk/articles/scripting/standardista_table_sorting">Standardista Table Sorting module</a> you can do just that.

Instant table sorting with very little fuss!
