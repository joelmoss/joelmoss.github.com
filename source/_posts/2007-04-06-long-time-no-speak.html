<p>Yes I know I have been quiet, but I've been busy... very busy! The fruits of my labours should be revealed shortly.</p>

<p>This post is to just a quick note to say goodbye. No not goodbye to all of you, my readers, but goodbye to PHP, the long time king of the web. I've used PHP for 7 years now and loved almost every part of that time. Its such an easy language to learn and use, and there is never a problem that cannot be resolved by referring to the PHP site and its excellent documentation.</p>

<h4>However! Ruby on Rails is just so damn cool!!</h4>

<p>I started playing around with Ruby on Rails late last year and was immediately impressed. But its severe lack of documentation turned me away from exploring and using it further. So I went back to PHP.</p>

<p>Hey, but it's not all doom and gloom. Because of my discovery of Rails, I started looking around for an equivalent framework for PHP. I found them all and tried them all, but two stood out above the rest; Symfony and CakePHP. Both are excellent at what they do, but Cake just took the biscuit :)</p>

<p>So I started refactoring Switchboard in Cake, but then that magnetic field that gathers around Rails grew bigger, and pulled me back in. And so I learned a little more with help from the many Rails and Ruby blogs out there.</p>

<p>But again, the lack of good documentation for Rails dropped me back to PHP.</p>

<h4>And rinse and repeat</h4>

<p>This pattern continued and continued, (I really gotta do something about my indecisiveness) until I actually produced something that worked in Rails. The time was right and it felt good, so off we went, hand in hand into the sunset. Just me, Ruby and Rails.</p>

<p>So this post is to officially say goodbye to PHP and officially welcome Ruby and Rails into my bosom!</p>

<h4>I'm converted! Hallelujiah!</h4>

<p>If you know whats good for you, you will too.</p>
