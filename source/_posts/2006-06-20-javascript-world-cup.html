<p>Just found an <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/article/javascript-library">excellent article</a> rounding up the 4 main Javascript libraries/frameworks on the as always reliable <a href="http://sitepoint.com/">SitePoint.com</a>.</p>

<p>The two page article delves into the nitty gritty of the Prototype, Yahoo User Interface, Mochikit and Dojo libraries, and really does tell you quite a lot about the pros and cons of each. It gives nice little examples of each library's best bits and adds what maybe missing from each.</p>

<p>I have already tried each of these prior to reading this article and had more or less decided on Prototype/Scriptaculous for <a href="http://tooum.com/">Tooum</a> and probably PXP, but now I want to use all of them.</p>

<p>But we shall see.</p>
