Didn't take me too long, so here is the <a href="http://cakeforge.org/snippet/detail.php?type=package&amp;id=15">final version of Cake Migrations</a> in all its glory. As well as support for the creation and dropping of tables, the main changes are as follows:
<ul>
	<li>Add/drop columns</li>
	<li>insert and remove test data (rows)</li>
	<li>run raw SQL queries</li>
	<li>rest the migration DB schema and destroy migration files</li>
</ul>
I think that pretty much covers all the bases, which is why I have announced it as the final version 1.0.

I have also updated the <a href="http://wiki.cakephp.org/tutorials:cake_migrations">Wiki</a> a little and included a few examples of the YAML migration files.
