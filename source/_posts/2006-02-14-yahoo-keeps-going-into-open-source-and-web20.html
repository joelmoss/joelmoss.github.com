This is great news. I knew <a href="http://yahoo.com">Yahoo</a> were actively participating in the open source community by proving a whole bunch of <a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/">API's</a> for their various services, but when a company the size of Yahoo releases a library of their own in house UI, you know they are doing something right.

Yahoo have really been pushing the whole Web2.0 thing and by opening up the sources to their <a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/yui/index.html">UI library</a> (that includes visual effects, connection handlers - think ajax -, dom handlers, and drag-and-drop controls) under a BSD license, they have opened up their company to a lot more users and developers - including me. I found myself really delving deep into their Developer Network pages and found some cool things, including <a href="http://widgets.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Widgets</a>. (my brain in racing with ideas for new Widgets already. Watch out HPU users!)

They have even pleased me even more by publishing a list of <a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/ypatterns/index.php">design patterns</a> that they use themselves. Briefly explaining the reason and need for the pattern and how it is acheived. Although it doesn't go into any great detail, you clearly get the point.

Yahoo, you've really stepped up to the mark. Thanks!
