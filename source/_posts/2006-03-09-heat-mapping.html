<p>Found a very promising site today; <a href="http://crazyegg.com">CrazyEgg</a> seems to be an analytics service for sites, but with a twist. It will show you a screenshot of your site, but with heat patterns overlaid. These heat patterns let you know what parts of your site are cliucked on the most. The hotter the area, the more it is clicked. Very nice idea!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve already registered my interest and await more info.</p>
