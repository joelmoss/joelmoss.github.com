I have a confession to make. I hate Captcha's!

Those stupid little images that are displayed to you during or after you register on a site, that display a set of almost completely unreadable letters and/or numbers. It simply infuriates me when I see them. I live and breathe the internet, but even I can't tell what I am supposed to be entering into the Captcha sometimes. Just imagine what it's like for non-technical types!

So today I stumbled across <a href="http://www.xero.com/">Xero</a>, and it picqued my interest enough for me to signup for the free trial. I completed the short signup form, and immediately after I see this:

<a href="/img/wpuploads/2008/08/picture-3.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-228 alignnone" title="Xero Captcha" src="/img/wpuploads/2008/08/picture-3.png" alt="" width="493" height="367" /></a>

No obsure image with a bunch letters that you can't see. I just get to finish a game of Tic-Tac-Toe! As long as I click on the correct square to finish the line with crosses, I'm in and registered.

Now that I might have to steal. Genius!
