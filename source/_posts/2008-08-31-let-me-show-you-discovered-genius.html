The reason why I love the internet soooo much, and why I spend so much time working and playing online is exactly why this blog was created. It's all about those moments when I find a site or online service/software, that simply blows me away with it's genius, and proves everything about what is so great about this thing we like to call the world wide web.

A few days ago, I found another one of those Discovered Genius', and wrote a quick <a href="http://twitter.com/joelmoss/statuses/900801152">Twitter post</a> on it. A few moments later, I wrote <a href="http://twitter.com/joelmoss/statuses/900802951">another</a>, using that <a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/2008/08/introducing-ubiquity/">Discovered Genius</a> that I had just found. And thus, a new blog was born at <a href="http://discoveredgenius.com">DiscoveredGenius.com</a>.

I downloaded the latest copy of Wordpress, installed it on my Mac, then proceeded to create a theme and add my favourite plugins. I uploaded it to my server, and began to write the <a href="http://discoveredgenius.com/2008/08/31/this-is-discovered-genius/">first post</a>.

So...

The idea is simple; every time I discover any sort of Genius that is in any way or form related to the Internet, or indeed, anything at all, I will write about here. It not only means I have a quick and easy way to keep tabs on the best stuff that I discover, but it lets me share it all with you, my dear reader.

<a href="http://discoveredgenius.com/2008/08/31/mozillas-ubiquity-brings-genius-to-firefox/">The first Discovered Genius</a> has already arrived, so head on over there. If you discover any that I may have missed, or simply overlooked, please drop me a line at joel [at] discoveredgenius [dot] com. I'm all ears!

And let me know your thoughts.
