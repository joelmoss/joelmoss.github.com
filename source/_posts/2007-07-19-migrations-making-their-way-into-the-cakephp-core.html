A few months ago, I discovered that the CakePHP core team had decided to include migrations into the core of the framework. Of course, I was quite chuffed that Nut and his colleagues found the idea and my code good enough to include in the actual framework. However, I soon discovered that they had no intention of using my code and were going it alone to produce their own version of Migrations. I was a bit gutted, but so be it.

Now finally the first traces of the CakePHP migrations shell have appeared on the <a href="https://trac.cakephp.org/changeset/5443">SVN sandbox</a>. It's early days, but so far so not so good. As already expected, there is no sign of YAML in the migration files. It seems that the core team don't like YAML, and so are sticking with bog standard PHP arrays. So instead of specifying your migration instructions in simple, easy to read and fast to type YAML, you will have to write them all in long winded, a pain to type and slow to type arrays!

<strong>WHY?</strong>

Now I know I have never really been in line with PHPNut's thinking and the ideals of the CakePHP project, but why do they feel the need to complicate things too much. As soon as the sandbox code is more fleshed out, I will show you what I mean. But I guarentee that YAML is faster and easier to use than arrays? Correct me if I am wrong, but a framework, by nature is supposed to make developing applications easier and faster.

So I am excited to see migrations finally appearing in the core, but why are they making it harder to use?

Let me put it this way, don't expect my migrations to disappear any time soon. I am still planning to develop and support them for as long as I feel they are needed, which certainly looks that way if arrays are used in the official migrations code.

PS: sorry for my rant, but don't you agree with me?
