Today I received an email informing me of a new <a href="http://twitter.com/joelmoss">Twitter</a> follower called <a href="http://twitter.com/widgetpress">widgetpress</a> . So I clicked on the users Twitter profile to check 'em out - as I usually do - and saw this post, which happened to be the users only post at the time:

<blockquote>Just released ModelBaker this week and going to private beta this weekend. Getting some real nice feedback.</blockquote>

Naturally this piqued my interest, and as most of my Twitter followers do so because of my work with CakePHP, I Googled Modelbaker and Widgetpress and found a site at <a href="http://www.widgetpress.com/">WidgetPress.com</a>, and ultimately the following video...

<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/PGqi0pWgEhk&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/PGqi0pWgEhk&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>

So basically, someone has created a Mac application, that can build a CakePHP web application without any coding knowledge at all. It lets you build your models, views and controllers, and even builds helpers for you. I also saw something about a template system, that lets you create a new Cake app based on a predefined application template.

Now this is not really something that I would use, as I'm one of them hard core developers who use a <a href="http://macromates.com/">text editor</a> (and enjoy doing so), but it is a great idea for beginners, and could do wonders for CakePHP and its community. I wish I could tell you more, but I want to reserve judgement and any further comments until I have actually tried this out. As soon as I do, I will be sure to let you all know.

You can see a bigger and <a href="http://www.widgetpress.com/modelbaker.mov">better quality version of this screencast</a> on the WidgetPress website, but needless to say it is very, very interesting, and testament to how powerful and easy to use CakePHP really is.
