I've been slowly moving all my public and private projects over to Git and Github whenever, and whereever I can. I've already created a mirror of the <a href="http://github.com/joelmoss/cakephp">CakePHP 1.2 branch at Github</a>, and I have a number of my private projects up too.

So I just completed the switch for CakePHP DB Migrations. The source is now available on <a href="http://github.com/joelmoss/cakephp-db-migrations/tree">Github</a> and is open to any pull requests. If you have any funky new features, or really need a bug fixed quickly, please feel free to fork the project. But please remember to send me a pull request.

I also moved the Google Code wiki into Github, and enhanced it a little. The <a href="http://github.com/joelmoss/cakephp-db-migrations/wikis">wiki</a> now includes some YAML migration examples, and will be expanded with more info and tutorials as and when I can.

The final step of the move, are the tickets/issues. And because it works so nicely with Github, I decided upon using <a href="http://devws.lighthouseapp.com/projects/19133-cakephp-db-migrations">Lighthouse</a>. So any bug reports, and/or feature requests should now be sent to <a href="http://devws.lighthouseapp.com/projects/19133-cakephp-db-migrations">Lighthouse</a>.

Thanks again for all the support. My hope in moving to Github, is that I can enhance the community aspect of this project, and to encourage more involvement from those of you who use it. I'm all ears!
