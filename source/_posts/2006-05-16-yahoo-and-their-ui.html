title: Yahoo and their UI

<p>I am increasingly mindful of the need for the use of Ajax and javascript effects within my upcoming projects. I have used <a href="http://prototype.conio.net/">Prototype</a> before, and <a href="http://script.aculo.us/">Scriptaculous</a> is just great for the job. But it seems that Yahoo are really doing a good job with their open source and community pushed initiatives.</p>

<p><a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2006/05/15/peeling-back-the-homepage-beta/">Peeling Back the Interface of the Yahoo! Home Page Beta</a> explains the extensive use of the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">Yahoo User Interface library and CSS Tools</a> within Yahoo's public beta of their homepage. Yahoo's UI Library really is competing to gain favour with us Prototype users and Ajax fans. And to be honest, it's good stiff. Yahoo's new homepage is a great testament to that.</p>

<p>So I may have to rething my usage of Prototype and look at the Yahoo UI, coz it really does have its advantages.</p>
