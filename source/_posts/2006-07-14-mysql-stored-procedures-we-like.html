title: MySQL Stored Procedures - We Like!
categories: articles
---
<p>Just finished reading an <a href="http://hades.phparch.com/ceres/public/article/index.php/art::mysql::sp_programming_mysql_5::part_1/0">excellent but simple article</a> all about <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/stored-procedures.html">MySQL 5's stored procedures</a>. Never heard of them prior to reading the article, but I must admit that I am mightily impressed by the simplistic, but powerful nature of stored procedures.</p>

<blockquote>A stored procedure is a set of SQL statements that can be stored in the server. Once this has been done, clients don't need to keep reissuing the individual statements but can refer to the stored procedure instead.</blockquote>

<p>It's almost like having all your SQL statements stored in a database table, and being able to run them using a simple function call; CALL HelloWorld<span class="br0">(</span><span class="br0">)</span>; In fact, that is exactly what it is like.</p>

<p>Bit late to use them in <a href="http://tooum.com/">Switchboard</a>, but I may use them in some future app.</p>
