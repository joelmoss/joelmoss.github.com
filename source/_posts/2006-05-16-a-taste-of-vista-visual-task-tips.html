<p>A little taster of things to came in the new Windows Vista and a touch of what MAC users have enjoyed for a while.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.visualtasktips.com/">Visual Task Tips</a> display a small thumbnail preview of each program running in your task bar. Simply roll over any program in your task bar and you get a great looking screen shot of that application.</p>
