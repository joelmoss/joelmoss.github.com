Well it finally happened and it is loooong overdue. as <a href="http://www.php.net/index.php#2007-07-13-1">announced</a> on the the official PHP site, PHP4 will reach its end of life n 2007-12-31. After which no more work will be done on PHP4, except critical security fixes.

So maybe we can start to see PHPNut and crew start to think about pushing CakePHP v2 with PHP5 only support?!
