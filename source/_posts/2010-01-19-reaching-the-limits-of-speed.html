<p>I'm sure most of you have already heard of Node.js, and have probably been blown away by what it can do, and it's possibilities. But do you really know how fast it can be?</p>

<blockquote><pre>
# node.js on freenode
spoob: technoweenie; seriously, you should look up how fast nodejs is... :)
technoweenie: yea i was getting about 5k r/s, pretty impressive
spoob: you should be getting around 20k r/s?
technoweenie: really?
technoweenie: oh wait i only ran 5k requests
</pre></blockquote>

<blockquote><pre>
# twitter
technoweenie: sample node.js server is *extremely* slow, am i missing something? i'm just trying the example app on nodejs.org  
technoweenie: oh i see, the demo app sets a 2s timeout, haha  
lifo: classic
technoweenie: hey that's a great way to start off a new web framework, simulate rails cgi speeds
</pre></blockquote>

<p>I am sure <a href="http://techno-weenie.net/2010/1/15/node-js-for-my-tiny-ruby-brain">Technoweenie</a> wouldn't mind me posting this, but I think it's hilarious.</p>

<p>I'm out! ;)</p>
