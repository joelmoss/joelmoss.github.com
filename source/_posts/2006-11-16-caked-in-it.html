<p>After much deliberation, I have decided to ditch my own framework design in favour of the power of the open source community.</p>

<p>CakePHP is now my preferred choice of PHP framework and my first task is to rebuild Cake Migrations and release it as version 2. I also plan on blogging a lot more, in particular about Cake. CakePHP that is ;)</p>

<p>So stand by for some bad-ass blogging.</p>
