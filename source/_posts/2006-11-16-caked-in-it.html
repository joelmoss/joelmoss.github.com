After much deliberation, I have decided to ditch my own framework design in favour of the power of the open source community.

CakePHP is now my preferred choice of PHP framework and my first task is to rebuild Cake Migrations and release it as version 2. I also plan on blogging a lot more, in particular about Cake. CakePHP that is ;)

So stand by for some bad-ass blogging.
