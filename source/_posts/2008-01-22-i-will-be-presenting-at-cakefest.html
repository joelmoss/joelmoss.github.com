<p>Well, it's official, I have been invited to give a presentation at <a href="http://cakephp.org">CakeFest</a> over the pond in Orlando, Florida in February. And I just sent an email back to Gwoo to confirm my attendance.</p>

<p>My presentation will be called "Cleaner development with database migrations" and will be totally wicked! ;)</p>

<p>So let me know if any of you are planning on attending. I would love to meet you all and catch up.</p>
