<p>I have released a new version of Cake Migrations. With thanks to <a href="http://ebroder.net/">Evan Broder</a>, Migrations now support additional column types: ENUM and BOOL. It also supports the creation and deltion of Keys and altering columns.</p>

<p>You can get version 1.1 of Cake Migrations from <a href="http://cakeforge.org/snippet/detail.php?type=package&amp;id=15">CakeForge</a>. More info on Cake Migrations and what they are can be found in the <a href="http://wiki.cakephp.org/tutorials:cake_migrations">Cake Wiki</a>.</p>

<p>Enjoy ;)</p>
