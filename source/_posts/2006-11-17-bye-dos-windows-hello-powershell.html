One of the worst thing I ever have to do while developing on Windows, is to use the windows DOS command window. It has to be one of the most unfriendly pieces of software of the planet. So when I heard that MS had just released version 1.0 of an all new shell command window for Windows entitled <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/powershell">PowerShell</a>, I quickly installed it and oh how I love it!
