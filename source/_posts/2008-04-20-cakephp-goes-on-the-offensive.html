It's all go in Cake land! This past week has seen some big changes in management [style] at the open source project, which has seen PHPNut temporarily step down as the lead developer of the project. And as a result, we've witnessed an increase on the amount of developers actually contributing to the core, including little ol' me! I committed <a href="https://trac.cakephp.org/changeset/6698" target="_blank">one</a> or <a href="https://trac.cakephp.org/changeset/6699" target="_blank">two</a> test cases over the weekend, and have seen two of my contributed patches become applied to the 1.2 branch.

This all means that we can expect to see a release candidate, or possibly even a final release of CakePHP 1.2 within the next month or two. Everyone now seems to be concentrating on fixing bugs, rather than adding more enhancements to a release that is already heaving with new features. And that's good news.

Of course, I could write a whole post or two on the reasons for these developments, but needless to say, if you have been active in the IRC channel over the last week, you will know what has been happening. I think we can expect some official post from Gwoo about what exactly has changed, which is better than me babbling on about it and possibly saying the wrong thing. You may have to wait a day or two, though, as apparently Gwoo is in Hawaii!

Anyway, I am off to see what other <a href="https://trac.cakephp.org/report/1" target="_blank">bugs</a> I can squash. I would love to see a final release in May. May 2008 that is!
