Just woke up to find I missed two exciting events in CakePHP land. First and most important is the release of Release Candidate 3 for 1.2. This release cannot be understated, although I think considering the amount of work that has been done on this release, we should be seeing a stable release of 1.2. I know it was only released a few hours ago, but right now there are a grand total of ONE bug. And that one bug will be fixed in 3 second, when I commit the fix ;). Go over to the Bakery and <a href="http://bakery.cakephp.org/articles/view/release-cakephp-rc3-the-rc-of-triumph">read the announcement</a> from Nate, and you will understand the amount of work that has been done.

Although I have been a small part of this, and helped by committing some fixes and enhancements, constraints on my time and family life have kept a some what tight lid on my commitment to contributing. But I hope to change that once 1.2 goes stable. As some of you know, I already have some cool new features waiting in my <a href="http://github.com/joelmoss/cakephp">unofficial CakePHP Github repo</a>. So hopefully these will appear in the core of 1.3, or maybe even 2.0!

Oh and by the way, a little bird tells me that Cake will be ditching SVN after 1.2 is released, and will be embracing Git and Github in all its glory. Watch this space!

Second exciting piece of news was the release of a new episode of <a href="http://live.cakephp.org/">The Show</a>. It's been a long period of quiet since the last show aired, so this episode is well worth the wait. Well, I am assuming it is, as we only got a one hour heads up <a href="http://twitter.com/nateabele/statuses/942894584">from Nate, on Twitter</a>. And that was when I was fast asleep. So I will will have to wait for the episode to be put online.

So congrats to all. I would also have to agree with Nate, on naming Mark Story, the man who has contributed the most to this release than any other person. So everyone please enjoy Mark Story Day!
