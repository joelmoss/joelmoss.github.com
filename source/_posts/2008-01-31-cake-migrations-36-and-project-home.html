In anticipation of <a href="http://cakefest.org">CakeFest</a> and my pending presentation at the event, I am releasing version 3.6 of Migrations and 3.4 of the Fixtures shell.

We got some nice new features in this release and I will be showcasing all of them in my presentation on Wednesday afternoon. The main change is the integration of <a href="http://www.4webby.com">Daniel Vecchiato's</a> <a href="http://www.4webby.com/blog/posts/view/3/yammy_db_to_yaml_shell_migrations_made_easy_in_cakephp">YAMMY shell</a>.

As well as this new release, I thought it would be a good idea to give Migrations a proper home, so I have created a Google Code project at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/cakephp-migrations/">http://code.google.com/p/cakephp-migrations/</a>

All new releases will now be available from there. I also added some more documentation both within the download package and on the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/cakephp-migrations/w/list">wiki</a>. I will continue to post here.

So now onwards and upwards with the presentation. Any body got any tips for a good one?
