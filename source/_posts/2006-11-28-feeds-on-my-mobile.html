<p>Well my one year old daughter decided to drop my PDA phone on the floor last week, and so with one year left on my contract, the damn thing wouldn't turn on. And because repairing it would mean I would have to wait 2-3 weeks, I had no choice but to get myself a new phone.</p>

<p>To be honest, I was half glad that she dropped it. My old phone weighed about as much as a small car and was becoming SOOOO slow.</p>

<p>So I got myself a brand new Sony Ericsson W850i and man am I pleased with it. It has everything I need, including 3G, bluetooth, and lots of stuff I don't, including a camera. But the phones best feature - and one that I didn't know it had - is its ability to show RSS feeds off the internet.</p>

<p>Now that is just genius!!</p>

<p>Now when I am out and about (or just plain bored), I can open up my phone, update my feeds and read them on the tiny litte screen.</p>

<p>Ever since I discovered this, my creative juices have been on overflow. I can think of so many possibilities for this.</p>
