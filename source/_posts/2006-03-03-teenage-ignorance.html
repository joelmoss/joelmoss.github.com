A school group visits a museum in Detroit and one of the teenage boys can&#39;t find a bin for his chewing gum, so he decides to stick it to one of the paintings. Turns out that this particular painting is worth over $1.5 million!!</p>

<p>&quot;The boy, who visited the Detroit Institute of Arts with a school group, has now been suspended by teachers.&quot;</p>

<p>He&#39;s gotta be kicking himself now.</p>
