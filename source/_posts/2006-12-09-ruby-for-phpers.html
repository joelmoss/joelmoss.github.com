<p>Just found a great little <a href="http://rsthree.com/2006/12/02/ruby-for-php-programmers/">article</a> that introduces Ruby to PHP programmers.</p>

<blockquote>While Ruby's documentation is at a point now where beginners can start digging in and learning quite rapidly, there appears to be a learning curve with developers coming from other languages. Ruby is a language that took the best ideas from many languages such as Perl, Lisp, Smalltalk, and others, and while some syntax is immediately familiar to a PHP developer, the more you really unlock the power of the language, the less it looks like anything we've seen before.</blockquote>

<p>It's definately <a href="http://rsthree.com/2006/12/02/ruby-for-php-programmers/">worth a read</a>.</p>
