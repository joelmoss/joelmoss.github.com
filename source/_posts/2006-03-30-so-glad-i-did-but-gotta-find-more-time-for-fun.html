<p>Speaking of gaming. We sold the wife&#39;s car last week, so I thought I would treat myself. So I went out and bought an Xbox 360 and I am so glad I did. Everything about it, from the wireless controllers to the Xbox Live service is wicked. Still waiting for the killer game that can really show off what the box can do, but at the moment I&#39;m happy with Ghost Recon and Burnout Revenge. The only problem I have now is finding the time to play it and tearing my 8 year old son away from it.</p>
