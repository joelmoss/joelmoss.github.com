<p>Today marks the <a href="http://bakery.cakephp.org/articles/view/release-pure-cake-power-in-rc1">release</a> of the long awaited first release candidate of CakePHP. Hopefully this will mean a final release will be close behind.</p>

<p>Congrats to all involved. Keep up the hard work.</p>

<p>On a side note, Cake now has an <a href="http://cakephp.org/jobs">official jobs board</a>. Nothing on there right now, but hopefully we will see more activity on there soon. So if you are looking for bakers, please post on there.</p>
