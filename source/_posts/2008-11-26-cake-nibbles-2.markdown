Welcome to the second edition of Cake Nibbles; where I tell you all about the latest goings-on in the world of CakePHP.

<strong>Cook Book goes open source</strong>

First up is the news that the <a href="http://book.cakephp.org/">Cake Cook Book</a> has been <a href="http://thechaw.com/cakebook">open sourced</a>. The best part of this news is that it uses Git and not Subversion for its source control. This is great news for the Cake community, and what is even greater is mentioned next...

<strong>Chew on The Chaw</strong>

I was a little puzzled at that one as well, and to be honest I still am. But as you may have noticed, the CookBook was released on a new service called <a href="http://thechaw.com/">The Chaw</a>. The Chaw is similar to <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>, in that it lets you host your Git repositories, and manage them online. But what sets The Chaw apart from Github, is that it also provides a ticketing/issue management system, which is something that Github sorely lacks. So apart from the name (what the hell is a Chaw?), this is great news.

<strong>CakeFest #2</strong>

December 2nd, will see the start of <a href="http://cakefest.org/">CakeFest #2</a>. The second official CakePHP conference will take place in Buenos Aires, Argentina between December 2nd and 5th, and is looking every bit as promising as the first CakeFest was in Orlando earlier this year.

<strong>New release of ModelBaker and appearance at MacWorld</strong>

A few months ago I <a href="http://developingwithstyle.com/articles/2008/09/06/modelbaker-a-desktop-application-for-building-cakephp-applications.html">blogged</a> about a promising new Mac application called <a href="http://www.widgetpress.com/">ModelBaker</a>. Well, a new release has just been announced, as well as news that ModelBaker will be in attendance at MacWorld Conference in January. Of course, it is still in closed Beta, but I do have access to that, and still intend to provide a short review and more info on that as soon as I can.
