<p>Lets start things off on a funny note. I saw the first two episodes of &quot;<a href="http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/I/itcrowd/">The IT Crowd</a>&quot; on Friday gone and loved every minute of both (although the first was funnier). I have now found out that you can watch these two episodes online via <a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/">BitTorrent</a>.</p>

<p>Take a look at the <a href="http://atariboy.wordpress.com/2006/02/03/the-it-crowd-episode-2/">post on AtariBoy&#39;s site</a> for the download links and split your sides with laughter.</p>
