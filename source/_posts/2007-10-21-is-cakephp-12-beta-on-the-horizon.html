There has been a flurry of activity in the CakePHP Subversion repository these last few days, including a whole bunch of changes merged into the 1.2 trunk. So the question I am asking myself is, can we expect to see the appearance of a solid beta version sometime soon?  I certainly hope so! I'll keep you posted.
