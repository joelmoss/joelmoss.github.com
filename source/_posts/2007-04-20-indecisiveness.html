<p>(have I spelt that right?)</p>

<p>Man I am just so damn indecisive! Don't get me wrong, I love Ruby and Rails. I love its expressiveness and  its beauty. I love its power. But for every productive day I have with it, there are another 2-3 that basically involves me banging my head against my shiny new Macbook. The learning curve seems to be too high.</p>

<p>Back in the day when I developed HomepageTools in Perl, making the switch to PHP was easy as pie. I think maybe that was because Perl had so many things wrong with it, but if Ruby is such a better language, why is it taking me longer to develop in?</p>

<p><strong>HELP ME!!!</strong> What do I do?</p>

<p>Shall I go back to PHP; a language that I have already mastered?</p>

<p><em>OR</em></p>

<p>Shall I stick with Ruby on Rails and contend with the learning curve and the time it takes to learn?</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>
