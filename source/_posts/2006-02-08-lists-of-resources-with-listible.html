<p>This is a nice little idea expanding upon the social bookmarking and <a href="http://digg.com">Digg</a> ideas. Listible is a Web2.0 site that lists lists! (well that got you confused didn&#39;t it?). I think we should let the people themselves explain:</p>

<blockquote>Listible is a new way to get relevant resources quickly.

By using Web 2.0 features such as AJAX, folksonomy (tagging), social elements such as voting/commenting and the listible&#39;s listonomy (listing), resources can be sorted in a way that will be digestible. You can search what you need quick. You can contribute your resources easier.

Why do we need tagging, voting and listing to sort resources?

Tagging is not the full answer. Tags can give you categorization, but it could not give you a destination. If you are trying to find resources on fixing CSS for IE browser&#39;s CSS bugs, usually you go to css tag, and very high chance that you will get millions of resources that is not about anything on IE browser bugs. You can try to find information with css joined with ie tags, but how can we know everyone uses both tags?

Voting cannot be the only answer for relevancy. Even though the most popular resources are on the top, if the system does not have a way to differentiate varies topics, you still wouldn&#39;t find any resources easily.

Listing combined with tagging and voting gives you a greater relevancy. Finding a list called &quot;Resources related to IE browser CSS bugs&quot; tagged with css is easier. In each list, community can provide any relevant URLs. The most relevant and popular resource will be sorted on the top, thanks to the voting system. Is this resource listible? If it is, then you are sharing the resources to the right person. This is listible all about.

There are so many different ways you can use the listible system. The sky is the only limit here.</blockquote>
