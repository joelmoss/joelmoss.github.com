  <div class="entry-content"><p>My brother-in-law, Adam popped round earlier today, and we got talking about work and business. I used to run a successful web hosting business with him a few years back, and we have always talked about business and work. While I&#8217;ve always been a hands-on kind of guy, Adam can be quite the opposite. However, we still both enjoy and love the thrill of running a business.</p>

<p>These days, I&#8217;m doing quite well as a freelance web developer, and building up Codaset into my next full time business. Adam is now a qualified financial advisor, and also doing well. We&#8217;re both good at what we do.</p>

<p>However, Adam is getting a little bored and frustrated with working for someone else. He wants to run a business; any business. It doesn&#8217;t matter what it is. The point is, he enjoys the process and task or running a business, no matter what it is.</p>

<p>So I tried to help him get fired up about finding a new business idea, and the best way to start it, all while still maintaining his day job. I suggested he borrow a book that I had just read, which I felt would really help him. &#8221;<a href="http://crushitbook.com/">Crush It</a>&#8221; by WineLibraryTV&#8217;s <a href="http://garyvaynerchuk.com/">Gary Vaynerchuck</a> is a great little book, and really cemented a few ideas that I already had in my head. Adam took the book, but he left the conversation still in a different mindset, and thinking that he needed to start a business by buying a franchise or some other existing company.</p>

<p>Of course, he could very well do that, but I see two big things wrong with that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>He needs a large amount of cash up front</li>
  <li>There is a higher amount of risk involved</li>
</ul>

<p>I then realised why he was looking at this way of starting a business. It&#8217;s because his primary goal is to make money. He wants to run a successful business because a successful business makes money. But that is the completely wrong way to go about running a business.</p>

<h4>I have a passion!</h4>
<p>I love the internet. I love developing web apps for the internet, and I love the endless possibilities that it gives me, with very little overheads or costs involved. The internet allows anyone who has a passion, to build that passion into an enjoyable business. It just so happens, that my passion is the internet.</p>

<p>We all have a passion. Some of you will already know what that passion is, and some of you may not have yet found your passion. Regardless of who you are, you have something that you enjoy doing, and that enjoyment can very easily turn into a passion.</p>

<h4>Ok, so what am I getting at here?</h4>
<p>Anything that you are passionate about will end up being something of quality. You will spend endless hours, and very, very late nights (and early mornings) being passionate about your passion. And you will do it well.</p>

<p>My point is, that when you run a business, it should be all about your passion, and not about the money. You should be doing it because you enjoy doing it regardless of how much money you make, if at all. My bet, is that if you truly love what you are doing, you will try you hardest to make sure that it is bloody good, and of the highest quality. And that is what makes a good business.</p>

<h4>So follow your passion trail, and NOT the money trail. If you do, your passion will turn into money.</h4></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
  So I&#8217;ve been working with <a href="http://sphinxsearch.com">Sphinx</a> a lot over the last few months for several different projects, including <a href="http://codaset.com">Codaset</a>. It&#8217;s an amazing piece of software, and solves the myriad of problems when trying to implement any kind of full text or intensive searches.
</p>




<p>
  But, it&#8217;s still not had a final release yet, as we are at 0.9.9. Which means that there may be some things missing or incomplete from the API. One thing I was missing was a way to find or add weight to exact matches. I can do phrase matching by enclosing the search string in quotes. But that returns all docs which include any or all of that phrase, which is fine, as I want to see all of them. But what I want to do is make sure that the exact matches are listed first, or are given increased weighting. And right now, that is not the case.
</p>




<p>
  So I had a think, and came up with the idea of including a new <code>SELECT</code> item in my Sphinx index. So we have something like this:
</p>




<div><figure role=code><figcaption><span>sql </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>SELECT CONCAT('__START__ ', my_field, ' __END__') AS exact_matched_field FROM table;</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>




<p>
  And now I can run the following Sphinx search, which will match my full and exact search string:
</p>




<div class="highlight"><pre>
  <span class="x">@exact_matched_field "__START__ my value __END__"</span>
</pre></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m sure most of you have already heard of Node.js, and have probably been blown away by what it can do, and it&#8217;s possibilities. But do you really know how fast it can be?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few months ago, I ditched my install of Wordpress and rebuilt this blog from the ground up using nothing but good old, raw HTML, with a little sprinkling of magic. At the time, I didn&#8217;t really talk about it much, so in this post I will be talking about how my blog is built, maintained and published using that little sprinkling of magic that is called Jekyll and Codaset Pages.</p>

<h3>Goodbye Wordpress</h3>

<p>Now don&#8217;t get me wrong here, but Wordpress is great at what it does. It&#8217;s probably the best blog engine available, and the fact that it has a huge community around it, makes it somewhat of a rock star in the open source community. But&#8230; what it tries to do is everything! It tries to answer all your blogging conundrums, which unfortunately actually places some restrictions on what you can or cannot do with your blog. Yes I can install a plugin, or even write one myself, but have you ever written a Wordpress plugin? Don&#8217;t! </p>

<p>What I am trying to say, is that blogging with Wordpress or any other automated blogging engine is not fun anymore. I know the point of a blogging engine is to allow you to publish without the need to write code, but you know what? I like writing code! I like having full control over what my blog does and what it looks like. And that is why I ditched Wordpress.</p>

<h3>Hello Jekyll</h3>

<p>What I didn&#8217;t want to do was to write my own blogging engine. In fact, I don&#8217;t want to use a blogging engine at all, at least not in the traditional sense. I just want a simple, unrestricted method of blogging. So I turned to <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/jekyll/">Jekyll</a>. Jekyll is a blog aware, static site generator written in Ruby, and in use by <a href="http://codaset.com">Codaset</a> and <a href="http://github.com">Github</a> for their pages feature. It lets you write raw HTML, or your template language of choice (Textile, Markdown), and even lets you create layouts. It then takes these templates and layouts and spits out a complete website or blog in a completely static form.</p>

<h3>And Hello Codaset Pages</h3>

<p><a href="http://pages.codaset.com">Codaset Pages</a> are a brilliantly simple way to host any static content, and works perfectly with Jekyll. Just create a new project under your Codaset account, then every time you &#8216;git push&#8217; to it, your site or blog is instantly updated. So I have a project called &#8217;<a href="http://codaset.com/joelmoss/joelmoss_pages">joelmoss_pages</a>&#8217;, which can be seen at <a href="http://joelmoss.codaset.com">http://joelmoss.codaset.com</a>. And that is this very blog.</p>

<p>You can see exactly how my blog is structured and have access to all the source code at <a href="http://codaset.com/joelmoss/joelmoss_pages">Codaset</a>, so I won&#8217;t go into too much detail. Just look at the <a href="http://codaset.com/joelmoss/joelmoss_pages">source</a> yourself. But what I will quickly do is show you how I wrote this blog post.</p>

<p>You can find the actual source file for this blog post <a href="http://codaset.com/joelmoss/joelmoss_pages/source/master/blob/articles/_posts/2009-12-09-goodbye-wordpress-hello-jekyll.html">right here</a>. Nothing special right? Wrong! The top four lines contain what we call &#8216;YAML front matter&#8217;, and they tell Jekyll which layout to use and the pages title. You can find the <a href="http://codaset.com/joelmoss/joelmoss_pages/source/master/blob/_layouts/post.html">layout here</a> and can see on line 66 where we include this blog post file.</p>

<p>Now I just load up my command line and cd to my &#8216;joelmoss_pages&#8217; working directory, and then &#8216;git push&#8217;. Codaset will then run Jekyll against my new blog post when I push it to the server. Which means that my blog post is published almost as soon as I push to my Git repository. There&#8217;s just something so bloody wicked about that!</p>

<p>And that, my friends is it! I have full control over what my blog post looks like, as I can edit the html directly and with very little effort. And I can very easily create any other pages of content just as quickly. I don&#8217;t have to mess about with the restrictions of a blog engine such as Wordpress, and there are no version upgrades to mess around with. I also don&#8217;t have to look at the messiest, spaghettiest codebase in the open source community, every time I want to add some sort of plugin.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I needed to send an email to all the users of Codaset, and wanted a quick and easy way to do so. So I just wrote a quick Rake task that will loop through all the users in the Codaset database, and send each one an email. However, when I was looking at how to send the emails, there didn&#8217;t seem to be an easy way to do so without having to write several lines of code just to send one email. What I needed was something similar to <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php">PHP&#8217;s mail() function</a> which lets me send an email with one line of code:</p>




<div><figure role=code><figcaption><span>php </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>mail('you@example.com', 'My Subject', $message);</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>




<p>I don&#8217;t need to use an SMTP server to send it, as it works just fine with sendmail.</p>




<p>Unfortunately, Ruby and Rails built in mail classes don&#8217;t offer such simplicity, which is very rare. But then I found <a href="http://github.com/benprew/pony">Pony</a>, which is a Ruby gem that mimics PHP&#8217;s mail function. Now I can can send an email in Ruby with one short line of code, and no configuration needed:</p>




<div><figure role=code><figcaption><span>ruby </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>Pony.mail(:to => 'you@example.com', :from => 'me@example.com', :subject => 'hi', :body => 'Hello there.')</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>




<p>Easy peasy!</p>




<p>For those of you who are interested, here is my rake task in its entirety:</p>




<div><figure role=code><figcaption><span>ruby </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
<span class='line'>2</span>

<span class='line'>20</span>
<span class='line'>21</span>
<span class='line'>22</span>
<span class='line'>23</span>
<span class='line'>24</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>require "pony"
</div><div class='line'>require "erb"
</div><div class='line'>
</div><div class='line'>desc "Send an email to all users"
</div><div class='line'>task :email_users => :environment do
</div><div class='line'>  raise "No template provided. Please set TEMPLATE=file_name" if ENV['TEMPLATE'].blank?
</div><div class='line'>
</div><div class='line'>  template  = File.read ENV['TEMPLATE']
</div><div class='line'>  subject   = ENV['SUBJECT'] || "Hello from Codaset"
</div><div class='line'>  
</div><div class='line'>  if ENV['TEST']
</div><div class='line'>    name = 'Joel Test'
</div><div class='line'>    Pony.mail :to => 'joel@developwithstyle.com', :from => "Codaset &lt;help@codaset.com>", :subject => subject, :body => ERB.new(template).result(binding)
</div><div class='line'>    puts "Email test ('#{subject}') sent to joel@developwithstyle.com"
</div><div class='line'>  else
</div><div class='line'>    User.find_each do |user|
</div><div class='line'>      unless user.email.blank?
</div><div class='line'>        name = user.title
</div><div class='line'>        Pony.mail :to => user.email, :from => "Codaset &lt;help@codaset.com>", :subject => subject, :body => ERB.new(template).result(binding)
</div><div class='line'>        puts "Email ('#{subject}') sent to #{user.email}"
</div><div class='line'>      end
</div><div class='line'>    end
</div><div class='line'>  end
</div><div class='line'>end</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>




<p>This simply loops through each user in the database, and sends them an email. The body of the email is built using a templated file, that uses ERB. Which means I can use it as a normal view template. I run it like this:</p>




<div><figure role=code><figcaption><span>ruby </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>rake email_users RAILS_ENV=production TEMPLATE=my_email_template.txt SUBJECT='Look at my email i sent ya!'</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://codaset.com/joelmoss/rails-concerns">Concerns</a> is a simple Rails plugin that provides you with a simple way to organise your Controllers, Models and Mailers, and split them into smaller chunks of logic. It is especially useful when you have lengthly models, and get fed up with having to scroll through several hundred lines of code.</p>




<h3>How does it work?</h3>




<p>So let&#8217;s say we have a Post model (doesn&#8217;t everyone?!) which is getting a bit lengthy, and frankly not very nice to look at. With the Concerns plugin, we can split it up into nice little chunks. Because we have lots of validations, let&#8217;s start by pulling them out and placing them within a concern file.</p>




<h3>Let&#8217;s get going then&#8230;</h3>




<p>First of all, install the plugin:</p>




<div class="highlight"><pre>
script/plugin install git://codaset.com/joelmoss/rails-concerns.git
</pre></div>




<p>Then, create a new directory in your app/models drectory and call it &#8220;post&#8221;, which is the same name as your model.</p>




<p>Within this new directory, create a new file at app/models/post/validations.rb. Now all this should do is reopen your Post model, and define your validations like this:</p>




<div><figure role=code><figcaption><span>ruby </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
<span class='line'>2</span>
<span class='line'>3</span>
<span class='line'>4</span>
<span class='line'>5</span>
<span class='line'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>class Post &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
</div><div class='line'>  validates_presence_of :title, :body
</div><div class='line'>  validates_uniqueness_of :title, :scope => :project_id, :case_sensitive => false
</div><div class='line'>  validates_exclusion_of :title, :in => %w(edit new blog delete destroy create update post posts)
</div><div class='line'>  validates_inclusion_of :markup_language, :in => %w( markdown textile wikitext ), :allow_nil => true
</div><div class='line'>end</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>




<p>It&#8217;s just like writing your model again.</p>




<p>Now within your main Post model; right at the top, we simply call:</p>




<div><figure role=code><figcaption><span>ruby </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>concerned_with :validations</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>




<p>Multiple concerns can be called like so:</p>
