  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since the announcement of the <a href="http://github.com/cakephp/debug_kit">DebugKit plugin</a>, and its source control taking place on <a href="http://github.com">Github</a>, there have been a slew of Cake users placing their code under Git control, in particular, on Github. So I thought I would give you all a run down of the great and good in Cake/Git land.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/joelmoss/cakephp-db-migrations"><strong>DB Migrations</strong></a></p>

<p>Oh come on! You didn&#8217;t really think I wouldn&#8217;t mention this one did ya? The easiest and best way to manage your database schema has been Gittified for a few months now. And already the new wiki has received contributions from people other than me.</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/joelmoss/cakephp-namedscope"><strong>Named Scope</strong></a></p>

<p>Last one of mine - I promise! Inspired by a Ruby on Rails feature, Named Scope is actually a very powerful and useful addition to Cake. I&#8217;ve started to use it extensively in my Cake apps. You really should check it out. You&#8217;ll wonder how you ever got by without it.</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/cakephp/debug_kit"><strong>Debug Kit</strong></a></p>

<p>Probably the most popular Cake repo controlled by Git and Github, this extremely useful plugin places a small bar at the top right of your app&#8217;s pages, presenting you with debugging data, such as your DB log, view variables, and params. This should be part of the core, and is the best example of how Git can really help with developing open source code, and encouraging others to contribute. It has already been forked several times.</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/rafaelbandeira3/cakephp-plugins"><strong>Rafael Bandeira&#8217;s Plugins</strong></a></p>

<p><em>Rafael Bandeira</em> created a couple of model behaviors, and has made them available on Github for all to see. One in particular sticks out and impresses, and that is the <a href="http://github.com/rafaelbandeira3/cakephp-plugins/tree/master/behaviors%2Flazy_loader.php">Lazy Loader behavior</a>. This will allow you to get related model data with simple, readable and nice method calls. <a href="http://rafaelbandeira3.wordpress.com/2008/11/21/lazy-loader-behavior-what-you-need-when-you-need-the-way-you-want/">His blog</a> explains more.</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/klevo/wildflower"><strong>Wildflower</strong></a></p>

<p>Wildflower is a very promising &#8220;Content management system and application platform built on the CakePHP framework and jQuery Javascript library&#8221;. I actually discovered this after a tip from Nate. If handled well, this could mean good things for Cake.</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/markstory/story-scribbles/tree/master/cakephp"><strong>Story Scribbles</strong></a></p>

<p>Cake&#8217;s very own <em>Mark Story</em> now has a Github repo full of lovely little Cake &#8216;scribbles&#8217;. Enjoy things such as his ACL based Menu component, web service behavior and his Geshi helper.</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/felixge/debuggable-scraps/tree/master/cakephp"><strong>Felix&#8217;s Scraps</strong></a></p>

<p>Another bunch of Cake bits and bobs, but this time from <em>Felix Geisendorfer</em>, he of <a href="http://debuggable.com/">Debuggable</a> fame. What interests me the most is his collection of datasources, allowing you to connect your Cake apps to external services such as Akismet, Amazon and Google.</p>

<p>These are just what I feel are the pick of the crop, but there is <a href="http://github.com/search?q=cakephp">a lot more</a> than I originally thought on Github, including an <a href="http://github.com/georgious/cakephp-yaml-migrations-and-fixtures">alternative migrations shell</a>, that doesn&#8217;t rely on Pear, and that just might spur me on to get rid of my reliance on the MDB2 library.</p>

<p>The Cake community seems to be loving Git right now. I only wish the powers that be will make that decision to switch.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Welcome to the second edition of Cake Nibbles; where I tell you all about the latest goings-on in the world of CakePHP.</p>

<p><strong>Cook Book goes open source</strong></p>

<p>First up is the news that the <a href="http://book.cakephp.org/">Cake Cook Book</a> has been <a href="http://thechaw.com/cakebook">open sourced</a>. The best part of this news is that it uses Git and not Subversion for its source control. This is great news for the Cake community, and what is even greater is mentioned next&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Chew on The Chaw</strong></p>

<p>I was a little puzzled at that one as well, and to be honest I still am. But as you may have noticed, the CookBook was released on a new service called <a href="http://thechaw.com/">The Chaw</a>. The Chaw is similar to <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>, in that it lets you host your Git repositories, and manage them online. But what sets The Chaw apart from Github, is that it also provides a ticketing/issue management system, which is something that Github sorely lacks. So apart from the name (what the hell is a Chaw?), this is great news.</p>

<p><strong>CakeFest #2</strong></p>

<p>December 2nd, will see the start of <a href="http://cakefest.org/">CakeFest #2</a>. The second official CakePHP conference will take place in Buenos Aires, Argentina between December 2nd and 5th, and is looking every bit as promising as the first CakeFest was in Orlando earlier this year.</p>

<p><strong>New release of ModelBaker and appearance at MacWorld</strong></p>

<p>A few months ago I <a href="http://developingwithstyle.com/articles/2008/09/06/modelbaker-a-desktop-application-for-building-cakephp-applications.html">blogged</a> about a promising new Mac application called <a href="http://www.widgetpress.com/">ModelBaker</a>. Well, a new release has just been announced, as well as news that ModelBaker will be in attendance at MacWorld Conference in January. Of course, it is still in closed Beta, but I do have access to that, and still intend to provide a short review and more info on that as soon as I can.</p>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2008-11-20T00:00:00+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Nov 20<span>th</span>, 2008</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I discovered the joys of NamedScope for Ruby on Rails quite a while ago now, and have always been an admirer. Its makes performing finds on models very elegant and convenient, by automagically creating model methods based on your pased scope params. Just like this:</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>ruby </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
</span><span class='line'>  named_scope :active, :conditions => {:active => true}
</span><span class='line'>  named_scope :inactive, :conditions => {:active => false}
</span><span class='line'>end
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'># Standard usage
</span><span class='line'>User.active    # same as User.find(:all, :conditions => {:active => true})
</span><span class='line'>User.inactive # same as User.find(:all, :conditions => {:active => false})</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>Then a few months ago I read <a href="http://codetunes.com/2008/09/05/named-scope-in-cakephp/">this blog post</a> and discovered that someone had created similar functionality for CakePHP, in the form of a model behavior. Although it&#8217;s not quite as powerful as it&#8217;s Rails cousin, it does let you define named scopes for any model quite easily. However, I wasn&#8217;t crazy about a few things.</p>




<p>Named Scopes are defined like this:</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>php </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>class User extends AppModel {
</span><span class='line'>  var $actsAs = array(
</span><span class='line'>    'NamedScope' => array(
</span><span class='line'>      'activated' => array('User.activated in not null'),
</span><span class='line'>      'online' => array('date_add(User.last_activity, interval 5 minute) > now()')
</span><span class='line'>    )
</span><span class='line'>  );
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>The above format means we can only pass find conditions to a named scope, and cannot pass any other params, such as ORDER and FIELDS.</p>




<p>Then a named scope is then called like this:</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>php </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$this->User->find('all', array('scope' => 'activated'));
</span><span class='line'>$this->User->find('all',
</span><span class='line'>  array('conditions' => 'points > 10', 'scope' => array('activated', 'online')))</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>I have to pass enough params to a find call as it is, so I don&#8217;t want anymore.</p>




<p>What I want to do is this:</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>php </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>class User extends AppModel {
</span><span class='line'>  var $actsAs = array(
</span><span class='line'>    'NamedScope' => array(
</span><span class='line'>      'active' => array(
</span><span class='line'>        'conditions' => array(
</span><span class='line'>          'User.is_active' => true
</span><span class='line'>        ),
</span><span class='line'>        'order' => 'User.name ASC'
</span><span class='line'>      )
</span><span class='line'>    )
</span><span class='line'>  );
</span><span class='line'>};</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>and this</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>php </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$active_users = $this->User->active('all');</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>I can even do this:</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>php </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$active_users = $this->User->active('all', array(
</span><span class='line'>    'conditions' => array(
</span><span class='line'>        'User.created' => '2008-01-01'
</span><span class='line'>    ),
</span><span class='line'>    'order' => 'User.name ASC'
</span><span class='line'>));</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>Much improved I think, and so much more powerful. <a href="http://codaset.com/joelmoss/cakephp-named-scope">So I&#8217;ve only gone and coded the damn thing</a>! You can find my version of Named Scope for Cake on Codaset at <a href="http://codaset.com/joelmoss/cakephp-named-scope">http://codaset.com/joelmoss/cakephp-named-scope</a>.</p>




<p>And you know what? Thanks to the power of CakePHP, the actual code is seven lines shorter than the aforementioned version.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since I discovered the <a href="http://github.com/cakephp/debug_kit">DebugKit plugin</a> for CakePHP that is currently in early development by Mark Story and others (including me. well, one commit still means I helped ;)), I have been left rocked about the power of plugins. I always thought that plugins were simply a way to create a Cake app that can be plugged in to an existing application. But It seems I underestimated their power.</p>

<p>So I began to think about how I could refactor Migrations into a plugin, rather than a bunch of files that you drop into your vendors directory. And that took me all of 20 seconds! I didn&#8217;t have to change a thing. Thanks to <a href="https://trac.cakephp.org/changeset/7871">this latest commit</a>, you can now use a shell script from any plugin.</p>

<p>So I just drop the migrations directory directly into my plugins directory, and wham bam thank you maam! I created my first Cake plugin.</p>

<p>Of course, I can still drop the migrations shells into my global vendors/shells directory, but I just like the way I can plug it in.</p>

<p>So a plugin is now the recommended way to use Migrations.</p>

<time datetime="2008-11-05T00:00:00+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Nov 5<span>th</span>, 2008</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Something that I have been taking advantage of in my Cake 1.2 apps for quite a while now, is the ability to separate your custom config options from your app&#8217;s core.php file. And I am pretty sure that it is one of those lesser know features in 1.2.</p>

<p>The core.php file within your app&#8217;s config directory is used to store application wide configuration variables. Things like your debug level, cache settings and sessions store are set here using Cake&#8217;s very useful Configure class. This file can start to get quite large and unruly as the development of your app progresses. So one of the first things I do when I start a new app, is to separate my custom application config variable into another file within the config directory. This then keeps the core Cake configure settings separate from your custom ones, and keeps things a little dry.</p>

<p>Just create a new file in your app/config directory. You can name this anything you want, but I usually go with something like &#8216;config.php&#8217; or &#8216;app.php&#8217;. As long as it ends with &#8216;.php&#8217;, it doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>

<p>Then in your app/config/core.php file, add the following line to the top of the file:</p>

<p><code>Configure::load('config');</code></p>

<p>As long as you pass the name of your newly created file, then it will be fine. So the above will work if I created a file called app/config/config.php.</p>

<p>Then within your new config file, you can set any config variables you wish. However, you don&#8217;t use the familar <code>Configure::write('name', 'value');</code> convention. The variables that you set within your custom config file should be specified using arrays. Like this:</p>

<p><code>$config['name'] = 'value';</code></p>

<p>All variables in this file only, should set within the <code>$config</code> array as array name/value pairs. If your custom config file is called &#8216;app.php&#8217;, then the array name would be <code>$app</code>. So effectively, you could create as many of these custom config files as you wish. Perhaps if you had distinct sections of the app. I usually just create one, so I can easily access my custom config vars, without worrying about Cake&#8217;s built in config vars.</p>

<p>You access these custom config variables in the exact same way as you would any of the other built in core config vars.</p>

<p><code>Configure::read('name');</code></p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been slowly moving all my public and private projects over to Git and Github whenever, and whereever I can. I&#8217;ve already created a mirror of the <a href="http://github.com/joelmoss/cakephp">CakePHP 1.2 branch at Github</a>, and I have a number of my private projects up too.</p>

<p>So I just completed the switch for CakePHP DB Migrations. The source is now available on <a href="http://github.com/joelmoss/cakephp-db-migrations/tree">Github</a> and is open to any pull requests. If you have any funky new features, or really need a bug fixed quickly, please feel free to fork the project. But please remember to send me a pull request.</p>

<p>I also moved the Google Code wiki into Github, and enhanced it a little. The <a href="http://github.com/joelmoss/cakephp-db-migrations/wikis">wiki</a> now includes some YAML migration examples, and will be expanded with more info and tutorials as and when I can.</p>

<p>The final step of the move, are the tickets/issues. And because it works so nicely with Github, I decided upon using <a href="http://devws.lighthouseapp.com/projects/19133-cakephp-db-migrations">Lighthouse</a>. So any bug reports, and/or feature requests should now be sent to <a href="http://devws.lighthouseapp.com/projects/19133-cakephp-db-migrations">Lighthouse</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks again for all the support. My hope in moving to Github, is that I can enhance the community aspect of this project, and to encourage more involvement from those of you who use it. I&#8217;m all ears!</p>
