  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just woke up to find I missed two exciting events in CakePHP land. First and most important is the release of Release Candidate 3 for 1.2. This release cannot be understated, although I think considering the amount of work that has been done on this release, we should be seeing a stable release of 1.2. I know it was only released a few hours ago, but right now there are a grand total of ONE bug. And that one bug will be fixed in 3 second, when I commit the fix ;). Go over to the Bakery and <a href="http://bakery.cakephp.org/articles/view/release-cakephp-rc3-the-rc-of-triumph">read the announcement</a> from Nate, and you will understand the amount of work that has been done.</p>

<p>Although I have been a small part of this, and helped by committing some fixes and enhancements, constraints on my time and family life have kept a some what tight lid on my commitment to contributing. But I hope to change that once 1.2 goes stable. As some of you know, I already have some cool new features waiting in my <a href="http://github.com/joelmoss/cakephp">unofficial CakePHP Github repo</a>. So hopefully these will appear in the core of 1.3, or maybe even 2.0!</p>

<p>Oh and by the way, a little bird tells me that Cake will be ditching SVN after 1.2 is released, and will be embracing Git and Github in all its glory. Watch this space!</p>

<p>Second exciting piece of news was the release of a new episode of <a href="http://live.cakephp.org/">The Show</a>. It&#8217;s been a long period of quiet since the last show aired, so this episode is well worth the wait. Well, I am assuming it is, as we only got a one hour heads up <a href="http://twitter.com/nateabele/statuses/942894584">from Nate, on Twitter</a>. And that was when I was fast asleep. So I will will have to wait for the episode to be put online.</p>

<p>So congrats to all. I would also have to agree with Nate, on naming Mark Story, the man who has contributed the most to this release than any other person. So everyone please enjoy Mark Story Day!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I received an email informing me of a new <a href="http://twitter.com/joelmoss">Twitter</a> follower called <a href="http://twitter.com/widgetpress">widgetpress</a> . So I clicked on the users Twitter profile to check &#8216;em out - as I usually do - and saw this post, which happened to be the users only post at the time:</p>

<blockquote>Just released ModelBaker this week and going to private beta this weekend. Getting some real nice feedback.</blockquote>


<p>Naturally this piqued my interest, and as most of my Twitter followers do so because of my work with CakePHP, I Googled Modelbaker and Widgetpress and found a site at <a href="http://www.widgetpress.com/">WidgetPress.com</a>, and ultimately the following video&#8230;</p>

<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/PGqi0pWgEhk&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/PGqi0pWgEhk&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>


<p>So basically, someone has created a Mac application, that can build a CakePHP web application without any coding knowledge at all. It lets you build your models, views and controllers, and even builds helpers for you. I also saw something about a template system, that lets you create a new Cake app based on a predefined application template.</p>

<p>Now this is not really something that I would use, as I&#8217;m one of them hard core developers who use a <a href="http://macromates.com/">text editor</a> (and enjoy doing so), but it is a great idea for beginners, and could do wonders for CakePHP and its community. I wish I could tell you more, but I want to reserve judgement and any further comments until I have actually tried this out. As soon as I do, I will be sure to let you all know.</p>

<p>You can see a bigger and <a href="http://www.widgetpress.com/modelbaker.mov">better quality version of this screencast</a> on the WidgetPress website, but needless to say it is very, very interesting, and testament to how powerful and easy to use CakePHP really is.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em><strong>Update:</strong> The Github repository I created now has an untouched clone of the CakePHP 1.2 SVN branch as the master. I then created a branch of this called &#8216;pimped&#8217;, which contains my own custom code. This means that you can choose to use the official Cake core, or my pimped copy. I&#8217;ll try to write a little more about my pimped branch in a future post.</em></p>

<p>For the last few months, I&#8217;ve been developing an application which I hope to release to the unsuspecting public very soon. So I wanted to get it on my server and tested remotely, which I promptly did by checking out a copy from my SVN repository. I also did the same for the Cake core, by checking out <a href="https://svn.cakephp.org/repo/branches/1.2.x.x/cake">https://svn.cakephp.org/repo/branches/1.2.x.x/cake</a>.</p>

<p>Great, all worked fine&#8230; until I spotted loads of errors in the app. I then remembered that I made some local changes to the Cake core. I know, I know, it&#8217;s a cardinal sin. But I really needed these changes for this app, and it was doing nobody any harm, as they stayed on my local machine. But now, I also needed them on my remote copy on the server, but want to be able to &#8216;svn up&#8217; the cake core, whenever there are updates.</p>

<p>So I figured the best way would actually be to use a different SCM just for this purpose. I&#8217;d played with <a href="http://git.or.cz/">Git</a> a little, and have been really impressed at <a href="http://github.com">Github</a>. So I created a public repo at Github, and proceeded to create a clone of the Cake SVN repo, which I then pushed to the public repo at Github. I then applied my custom changes, and now we have a mirror of the CakePHP 1.2 branch at <a href="https://github.com/joelmoss/cakephp/tree">https://github.com/joelmoss/cakephp/tree</a>.</p>

<p>I can now clone the new git repo on my remote server, and I have a copy of CakePHP with all my custom changes, which I can update as and when I need to. This is all assuming of course, that I regulalry update the repo from the Cake SVN repo.</p>

<p>So things have actually turned out quite well. Please feel free to push and pull to/from the new <a href="http://github.com/joelmoss/cakephp/tree/master">git repo</a>, and let me know your thoughts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s been a long time coming, but finally we have not one, but two books on the CakePHP framework about to be released.</p>

<p>The first from <a href="http://www.packtpub.com">Packt Publishing</a>, entitled &#8221;<a href="http://www.packtpub.com/cakephp-application-development/book">CakePHP Application Development</a>&#8221; was recently announced on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/cake-php/browse_thread/thread/b33b85c9792a9d12?hl=en">Cake Google group</a> and is out now.</p>

<blockquote>This book offers step-by-step instructions to learn the CakePHP framework and to quickly develop and deploy web-based applications. It introduces the MVC pattern and coding styles using practical examples. It takes the developer through setting up a CakePHP development and deployment environment, and develops an example application to illustrate all of the techniques you need to write a complete, non-trivial application in PHP. It aims to assist PHP programmers to rapidly develop and deploy well-crafted and robust web-based applications with CakePHP.</blockquote>


<p>The second, which is due to be published this month, is from Apress and is called &#8220;Beginning CakePHP: From Novice to Professional&#8221;.</p>

<blockquote>Leads you from a basic setup of CakePHP to building a couple applications that will highlight CakePHP&#8217;s functionality and capabilities without delving too deeply into the PHP language, but rather what the CakePHP framework can offer the developer. Targets beginners of CakePHP or web frameworks in general as well as experienced developers with limited exposure to CakePHP. A secondary audience may include developers undecided on adopting CakePHP or business managers trying to assess the value of incorporating CakePHP into their toolbox.</blockquote>


<p>Both books can be purchased and downloaded in PDF format, or in posted to you in paper form.</p>

<p>This is good news for Cake and its community, as good quality books can really help an open source project grow and mature. And of course, it helps those who aren&#8217;t familar with how the framework works.</p>

<p>So get buying and tell everyone.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In todays <a href="http://bakery.cakephp.org/articles/view/release-pure-cake-power-in-rc1">announcement</a> on the release of CakePHP RC1, Gwoo mentioned the use of <a href="http://www.ohloh.net">Ohlo</a> and in particular, their Journalling feature. I hadn&#8217;t heard of Ohlo before, so I took a look. Seems a great idea, and touches along the lines of <a href="http://github.com">Github</a> (but nowhere near as well). It&#8217;s basically somewhat of a social networking site for open source projects, and taps into each projects source control system to display changesets and activity. You can rate developers and users, and discover other projects of a similar nature, or with similar tags.</p>

<p>Anyway, I tried registering, but got an error when trying to login, and I have yet to receive my validation email. I was about to give up when I found a curious little box near the bottom of the <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/cakephp">CakePHP project page</a>.</p>

<p>So according to Ohlo, if you wanted to recreate CakePHP in its entirity and copy everything it has, it woul take one person 24 years to complete, and cost nearly $1.4 million!</p>

<p>Now, I&#8217;m not taking away from the huge amount of work that has gone into the core by umpteen members of the community, but doesn&#8217;t that sound a little bit off to you? It seems they use some sort of mathematical calculation based on lines of code etc. But to be honest I really felt that that made a mockery of both Ohlo as a viable service, and CakePHP as a very successful open source project.</p>

<p>Anyway, I just really felt the need to let you all know about that one. I thought it was funny.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today marks the <a href="http://bakery.cakephp.org/articles/view/release-pure-cake-power-in-rc1">release</a> of the long awaited first release candidate of CakePHP. Hopefully this will mean a final release will be close behind.</p>

<p>Congrats to all involved. Keep up the hard work.</p>

<p>On a side note, Cake now has an <a href="http://cakephp.org/jobs">official jobs board</a>. Nothing on there right now, but hopefully we will see more activity on there soon. So if you are looking for bakers, please post on there.</p>
