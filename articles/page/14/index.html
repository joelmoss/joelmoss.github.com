  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, it finally happened. On April 12th, I sold HomepageUniverse and permanently left the web hosting company I started over seven years ago. And you know what? It feels good, and man am I excited?!</p>

<p>So what now?</p>

<p>Well, I got lots of ideas, including some freelance web design and programming work, as well as a few small projects. I also have a few opportunities for employment that I am exploring. I just want to try it all and find out what else is out there.</p>

<p>So with that in mind, I would love to know if I am needed! Do you need an experienced programmer, web designer, business consultant, or just a guy who has been there and bought the t-shirt? Whatever you need ad in whatever capacity you need me in, I would love to talk with you about it, as I am sure that  can help you.</p>

<p>So please get in touch and email me at joel [at] joelmoss [dot] info about anything you want.</p>

<p>Thanks again to all.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(have I spelt that right?)</p>

<p>Man I am just so damn indecisive! Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love Ruby and Rails. I love its expressiveness and  its beauty. I love its power. But for every productive day I have with it, there are another 2-3 that basically involves me banging my head against my shiny new Macbook. The learning curve seems to be too high.</p>

<p>Back in the day when I developed HomepageTools in Perl, making the switch to PHP was easy as pie. I think maybe that was because Perl had so many things wrong with it, but if Ruby is such a better language, why is it taking me longer to develop in?</p>

<p><strong>HELP ME!!!</strong> What do I do?</p>

<p>Shall I go back to PHP; a language that I have already mastered?</p>

<p><em>OR</em></p>

<p>Shall I stick with Ruby on Rails and contend with the learning curve and the time it takes to learn?</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yes I know I have been quiet, but I&#8217;ve been busy&#8230; very busy! The fruits of my labours should be revealed shortly.</p>

<p>This post is to just a quick note to say goodbye. No not goodbye to all of you, my readers, but goodbye to PHP, the long time king of the web. I&#8217;ve used PHP for 7 years now and loved almost every part of that time. Its such an easy language to learn and use, and there is never a problem that cannot be resolved by referring to the PHP site and its excellent documentation.</p>

<h4>However! Ruby on Rails is just so damn cool!!</h4>

<p>I started playing around with Ruby on Rails late last year and was immediately impressed. But its severe lack of documentation turned me away from exploring and using it further. So I went back to PHP.</p>

<p>Hey, but it&#8217;s not all doom and gloom. Because of my discovery of Rails, I started looking around for an equivalent framework for PHP. I found them all and tried them all, but two stood out above the rest; Symfony and CakePHP. Both are excellent at what they do, but Cake just took the biscuit :)</p>

<p>So I started refactoring Switchboard in Cake, but then that magnetic field that gathers around Rails grew bigger, and pulled me back in. And so I learned a little more with help from the many Rails and Ruby blogs out there.</p>

<p>But again, the lack of good documentation for Rails dropped me back to PHP.</p>

<h4>And rinse and repeat</h4>

<p>This pattern continued and continued, (I really gotta do something about my indecisiveness) until I actually produced something that worked in Rails. The time was right and it felt good, so off we went, hand in hand into the sunset. Just me, Ruby and Rails.</p>

<p>So this post is to officially say goodbye to PHP and officially welcome Ruby and Rails into my bosom!</p>

<h4>I&#8217;m converted! Hallelujiah!</h4>

<p>If you know whats good for you, you will too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just knocked up another bake2 task for CakePHP 1.2 that I think is pretty damn cool.</p>

<p>The Notes Task is a source-annotations extractor! ?!?!</p>

<p>What&#8217;s that then? I hear you ask. Well, this task is a great way to keep track of your ToDo&#8217;s and FixMe&#8217;s that are most likely littering all over your code.</p>

<p>I have started adding annotations to my code to remind me to do, fix or optimise something within the    code. Just add any of the following anywhere in your code - usually at the point that needs attention:</p>

<pre><code># TODO: this is my first todo item
# FIXME: please fix this
# OPTIMIZE: this has got to be optimised!
</code></pre>


<p>The problem with this is how to track them all. So that is why I created this Notes Task.</p>

<p>Just get the code from <a href="http://cakeforge.org/snippet/detail.php?type=snippet&amp;id=170">CakeForge</a>, save [it as notes_task.php in your vendors/tasks directory and then run:</p>

<pre><code>php bake2.php notes app_alias</code></pre>


<p>and the task will check all your PHP scripts in your app for any of the above notes and print them out in a nice readable format, with line numbers, etc.</p>

<p>You can find specific notes like so:</p>

<pre><code>bake2.php notes app_alias todo
bake2.php notes app_alias fixme
bake2.php notes app_alias optimise
</code></pre>


<p>As a side note, you can now also find my other tasks - including migrations - at CakeForge.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://cakeforge.org/snippet/detail.php?type=snippet&amp;id=165">Migration Task</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://cakeforge.org/snippet/detail.php?type=snippet&amp;id=166">Fixture Task</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://cakeforge.org/snippet/detail.php?type=snippet&amp;id=167">Generator Task</a></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just checked out the CakePHP 1.2 branch this morning and discovered a shiny new class called Debugger. It&#8217;s pretty obvious what this is, but it ain&#8217;t no simple debugging function.</p>

<p>The Debugger replaces the default PHP error handling and &#8220;provides enhanced logging, stack traces, and rendering debug views&#8221;. Basically, if any errors occur, Debugger will print these to your browser and tell you everything you need to know about the problem.</p>

<p>To use it, simply include the Debugger class file into your app. This can be achieved very easily by placing the following line at the top of your app/config/bootstrap.php file:</p>

<pre><code>uses('debugger');</code></pre>


<p>And now you get all the data you need when something goes wrong, and right within your browser.</p>

<p>One thing that is lacking though, that I would really like to see, is the option to output the debugging results to a log file instead. As outputting to the browser can be very messy. I have already opened a ticket with this suggestion, so hopefully the core team will add that.</p>
