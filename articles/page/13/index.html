  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few months ago, I discovered that the CakePHP core team had decided to include migrations into the core of the framework. Of course, I was quite chuffed that Nut and his colleagues found the idea and my code good enough to include in the actual framework. However, I soon discovered that they had no intention of using my code and were going it alone to produce their own version of Migrations. I was a bit gutted, but so be it.</p>

<p>Now finally the first traces of the CakePHP migrations shell have appeared on the <a href="https://trac.cakephp.org/changeset/5443">SVN sandbox</a>. It&#8217;s early days, but so far so not so good. As already expected, there is no sign of YAML in the migration files. It seems that the core team don&#8217;t like YAML, and so are sticking with bog standard PHP arrays. So instead of specifying your migration instructions in simple, easy to read and fast to type YAML, you will have to write them all in long winded, a pain to type and slow to type arrays!</p>

<p><strong>WHY?</strong></p>

<p>Now I know I have never really been in line with PHPNut&#8217;s thinking and the ideals of the CakePHP project, but why do they feel the need to complicate things too much. As soon as the sandbox code is more fleshed out, I will show you what I mean. But I guarantee that YAML is faster and easier to use than arrays? Correct me if I am wrong, but a framework, by nature is supposed to make developing applications easier and faster.</p>

<p>So I am excited to see migrations finally appearing in the core, but why are they making it harder to use?</p>

<p>Let me put it this way, don&#8217;t expect my migrations to disappear any time soon. I am still planning to develop and support them for as long as I feel they are needed, which certainly looks that way if arrays are used in the official migrations code.</p>

<p>PS: sorry for my rant, but don&#8217;t you agree with me?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well it finally happened and it is loooong overdue. as <a href="http://www.php.net/index.php#2007-07-13-1">announced</a> on the the official PHP site, PHP4 will reach its end of life n 2007-12-31. After which no more work will be done on PHP4, except critical security fixes.</p>

<p>So maybe we can start to see PHPNut and crew start to think about pushing CakePHP v2 with PHP5 only support?!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>YAY!  did it!!</p>

<p>After umpteen attempts at creating my very first screencast, I finally completed one that I was happy with. At 20 minutes, it is a little longer than I wanted, but hopefully future casts will shorten with experience. This is planned to be the first of a series of screencasts, not just about Migrations, but about life with Cake.</p>

<p>So without further ado, I proudly present Screencast Episode 1: How to use CakePHP Database Migrat
ions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As promised, I am attempting to create a screencast all about Cake migrations, and the joys of using it. But man is it hard! So far I am on attempt number 10 and counting. I just keeping messing up, or forgetting something. But I am determined to get this done and posted here before I go to sleep tonight, so I am prepared for long night.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last month I read - more like scanned - over a <a href="http://www.thinkingphp.org/2007/05/13/bringing-the-cold-war-to-cakephp-12-the-containable-behavior/">post</a> on Felix Geisendorfer&#8217;s (the_undefined) <a href="http://www.thinkingphp.org">blog</a> all about a new behaviour he had just written for CakePHP. At the time I didn&#8217;t really get it and so didn&#8217;t see its value. But today while progressing with my Cake rewrite of Switchboard, I had a need to limit the associations that Cake was returning. The most obvious way was to play with the $recursive variable in my models, but that just isn&#8217;t fine grained enough. So I hopped on over to the Cake IRC channel and asked how others were doing it. Luckily for me, Felix had also hopped on over and suggested I take a look at his containable behaviour. He had just released <a href="http://www.thinkingphp.org/2007/06/14/containable-20-beta/">version 2.0</a>, so I grabbed the code and started playing.</p>

<p>Why the hell didn&#8217;t I ever use this before? It has solved all my association problems and is so damn easy to use. Just stop what you are doing right now and get his code and add the behaviour to your cake apps. I promise you that you will never look back.</p>

<p>Core team, if you are reading this then you have to put this in the core.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Cake DB Migrations has now been updated to work with the very latest version of CakePHP 1.2 and the new (hopefully final) console/shells system. I have also added a few extra goodies to make life a little easier.</p>

<p>The new features and changes are as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>You can now specify a column without the need to specify the column type. Type is set to string, which is simply a varchar(255) column.</li>
    <li>Ability to add user definable foreign keys by simply specifying the &#8216;fkey&#8217; as a column name, followed by the name(s) of the foreign key(s).</li>
    <li>You can now include PHP code within the YAML migration files</li>
</ul>


<p>Because the console system in Cake 1.2 has changed a bit, you now have to place the below script in a slightly different place. Within your main &#8216;vendors&#8217; directory above your app and cake core directories, paste the below code into a file called &#8216;migrate.php&#8217; and place that file in a directory called &#8216;shells&#8217;.</p>

<p>Now just bring up your favourite command line tool and cd into your cake applications root directory and run the following:</p>

<pre><code>./cake migrate</code></pre>


<p>And that is it! That will migrate to the lastest version. You can specify the version like this:</p>

<pre><code>./cake migrate -v 3</code></pre>


<p>As promised, I hope to create a screencast going through all aspects of migrations and how they can save your life.</p>

<p>You can find the script in <a href="http://cakeforge.org/snippet/detail.php?type=snippet&amp;id=165">CakeForge</a>, aswell as new versions of the <a href="http://cakeforge.org/snippet/detail.php?type=snippet&amp;id=166">Fixtures</a> and <a href="http://cakeforge.org/snippet/detail.php?type=snippet&amp;id=167">Generator</a> shells.</p>
