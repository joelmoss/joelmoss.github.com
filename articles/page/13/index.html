  <div class="entry-content"><p>YAY!  did it!!</p>

<p>After umpteen attempts at creating my very first screencast, I finally completed one that I was happy with. At 20 minutes, it is a little longer than I wanted, but hopefully future casts will shorten with experience. This is planned to be the first of a series of screencasts, not just about Migrations, but about life with Cake.</p>

<p>So without further ado, I proudly present Screencast Episode 1: How to use CakePHP Database Migrat
ions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As promised, I am attempting to create a screencast all about Cake migrations, and the joys of using it. But man is it hard! So far I am on attempt number 10 and counting. I just keeping messing up, or forgetting something. But I am determined to get this done and posted here before I go to sleep tonight, so I am prepared for long night.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last month I read - more like scanned - over a <a href="http://www.thinkingphp.org/2007/05/13/bringing-the-cold-war-to-cakephp-12-the-containable-behavior/">post</a> on Felix Geisendorfer&#8217;s (the_undefined) <a href="http://www.thinkingphp.org">blog</a> all about a new behaviour he had just written for CakePHP. At the time I didn&#8217;t really get it and so didn&#8217;t see its value. But today while progressing with my Cake rewrite of Switchboard, I had a need to limit the associations that Cake was returning. The most obvious way was to play with the $recursive variable in my models, but that just isn&#8217;t fine grained enough. So I hopped on over to the Cake IRC channel and asked how others were doing it. Luckily for me, Felix had also hopped on over and suggested I take a look at his containable behaviour. He had just released <a href="http://www.thinkingphp.org/2007/06/14/containable-20-beta/">version 2.0</a>, so I grabbed the code and started playing.</p>

<p>Why the hell didn&#8217;t I ever use this before? It has solved all my association problems and is so damn easy to use. Just stop what you are doing right now and get his code and add the behaviour to your cake apps. I promise you that you will never look back.</p>

<p>Core team, if you are reading this then you have to put this in the core.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Cake DB Migrations has now been updated to work with the very latest version of CakePHP 1.2 and the new (hopefully final) console/shells system. I have also added a few extra goodies to make life a little easier.</p>

<p>The new features and changes are as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>You can now specify a column without the need to specify the column type. Type is set to string, which is simply a varchar(255) column.</li>
    <li>Ability to add user definable foreign keys by simply specifying the &#8216;fkey&#8217; as a column name, followed by the name(s) of the foreign key(s).</li>
    <li>You can now include PHP code within the YAML migration files</li>
</ul>


<p>Because the console system in Cake 1.2 has changed a bit, you now have to place the below script in a slightly different place. Within your main &#8216;vendors&#8217; directory above your app and cake core directories, paste the below code into a file called &#8216;migrate.php&#8217; and place that file in a directory called &#8216;shells&#8217;.</p>

<p>Now just bring up your favourite command line tool and cd into your cake applications root directory and run the following:</p>

<pre><code>./cake migrate</code></pre>


<p>And that is it! That will migrate to the lastest version. You can specify the version like this:</p>

<pre><code>./cake migrate -v 3</code></pre>


<p>As promised, I hope to create a screencast going through all aspects of migrations and how they can save your life.</p>

<p>You can find the script in <a href="http://cakeforge.org/snippet/detail.php?type=snippet&amp;id=165">CakeForge</a>, aswell as new versions of the <a href="http://cakeforge.org/snippet/detail.php?type=snippet&amp;id=166">Fixtures</a> and <a href="http://cakeforge.org/snippet/detail.php?type=snippet&amp;id=167">Generator</a> shells.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you keep an eye on the <a href="http://trac.cakephp.org">CakePHP trac</a> or the <a href="http://bakery.cakephp.org">Bakery</a>, you should have noticed that PHPNut and friends have just pushed out the latest alpha release of CakePHP 1.2.</p>

<p>Version 1.2.0.5137alpha introduces an all new caching system that supports multiple cache backends, including apc, memcache, xcache, file, and models. I have yet to explore this, but I intend to when I get a need for it.</p>

<p>Another major change/addition, is the old scripts system. This is now known as Cake&#8217;s console shells and is a step in the right direction. It is now even easier to create console scripts (sorry; shells) when working with your app in Cake. I have already refactored my various tasks to work with this new system. So watch out for a new version of Cake Migrations and Fixtures.</p>

<p>A couple of other changes include a translation behaviour and improvements to the Security component. And according to PHPNut, this should be the last alpha release before beta is reached:</p>

<blockquote>We have some more changes before we can release the Beta. The most major change will be the transition from defines in core.php to the $config array used by the Configure class. This will be the last release that allows for defines inside of core.php. Moving away from defines provides much greater flexibility. The next release will also see the inclusion of a Session model, which will allow easier access to the database session handling.</blockquote>


<p>So as you may recognise, I have decided to leave Rails alone for a while and concentrate on developing with CakePHP, and perhaps helping out a bit in the community. I also have a few more scripts that I hope to make available to the public, that are currently making my life even easier with Cake.</p>

<p>And finally, I will soon be launching a really exciting new project that I hope will help the Cake community grow even more. If you know of Ryan Bates and his excellent <a href="http://railscasts.com">Railscasts</a> site, then you will like what I have planned.</p>

<p>Keep it here! ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, it finally happened. On April 12th, I sold HomepageUniverse and permanently left the web hosting company I started over seven years ago. And you know what? It feels good, and man am I excited?!</p>

<p>So what now?</p>

<p>Well, I got lots of ideas, including some freelance web design and programming work, as well as a few small projects. I also have a few opportunities for employment that I am exploring. I just want to try it all and find out what else is out there.</p>

<p>So with that in mind, I would love to know if I am needed! Do you need an experienced programmer, web designer, business consultant, or just a guy who has been there and bought the t-shirt? Whatever you need ad in whatever capacity you need me in, I would love to talk with you about it, as I am sure that  can help you.</p>

<p>So please get in touch and email me at joel [at] joelmoss [dot] info about anything you want.</p>

<p>Thanks again to all.</p>
