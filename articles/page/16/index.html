  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well this week, after months of &#8220;will I won&#8217;t I?&#8221;, and &#8220;shall I, should I?&#8221;, I finally sat down and began to write my first app with <a href="http://rubyonrails.com">Ruby on Rails</a>. And you know what? It was, and is fun!</p>

<p>Admitedly, I haven&#8217;t gotten very far, but I do now have a basic understanding of the Ruby language and how Rails works. And I can&#8217;t yet say whether I will be saying bye to Cake and PHP. I still want to do more with Rails and really see if I can develop faster and easier.</p>

<p>But what I would like to do right now, is give those of you who were in the same boat as me, who want to learn Rails but don&#8217;t know where to start. The following are a list of resources that I have found invaluable in my learning of Ruby and Rails.</p>

<h3>Walk before you can run</h3>


<p>Some of you may not know this, but Ruby on Rails is not a programming language, it is a framework, or collection of scripts written in the Ruby programming language, that provide faster and enjoyable development. I could tell you to launch straight into Rails, but that would be foolish, as you gotta learn to walk before you can run.</p>

<p>The best start I can possibly recommend is to run through the <a href="http://tryruby.hobix.com/">&#8220;Try Ruby in 15 minutes&#8221;</a> interactive tutorial. Just sit back and watch and learn.</p>

<h3>Try a Humble Little Ruby Book</h3>


<p>Although I first started to read <a href="http://www.manning.com/black/">Ruby for Rails</a>, I didn&#8217;t really fully grasp the Ruby language until I read <a href="http://www.humblelittlerubybook.com/">Mr. Neighborly&#8217;s Humble Little Ruby Book</a>.</p>

<p>Readable online and in PDF, this free six chapter ebook is written so well and explains the basics of Ruby.</p>

<blockquote>An up to date book on Ruby programming, written in a style described as &#8220;a beautiful display of pragmatically chunky bacon, wrapped in a nutshell.&#8221; Or something like that.

Mr. Neighborly&#8217;s Humble Little Ruby Book covers the Ruby language from the very basics of using puts to put naughty phrases on the screen all the way to serving up your favorite web page from WEBrick or connecting to your favorite web service. Written in a conversational narrative rather than like a dry reference book, Mr. Neighborly&#8217;s Humble Little Ruby Book is an easy to read, easy to follow guide to all things Ruby.</blockquote>




<h3>Get Agile with Rails</h3>


<p>By now you should have a basic understanding of Ruby and are probably chewing at the bit to get started with Rails. So read the last book you will every need - <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/title/rails/"> Agile Web Development with Rails</a>.</p>

<p>This award winning book really explains Rails in a way that will get you started immediately.</p>

<blockquote>With this book, you&#8217;ll learn how to use ActiveRecord to connect business objects and database tables. No more painful object-relational mapping. Just create your business objects and let Rails do the rest. Need to create and modify your schema? Migrations make it painless (and they&#8217;re versioned, so you can roll changes backward and forward). You&#8217;ll learn how to use the Action Pack framework to route incoming requests and render pages using easy-to-write templates and components. See how to exploit the Rails service frameworks to send emails, implement web services, and create dynamic, user-centric web-pages using built-in Javascript and Ajax support. There are extensive chapters on testing, deployment, and scaling.</blockquote>




<h3>The Official docs</h3>


<p>The Ruby and Rails community is thriving, and so there are plenty of well written blogs out there that are perfect companion pieces for your journey on Rails. But before I tell you about the best ones, don&#8217;t forget about the <a href="http://rubyonrails.com">official Ruby on Rails site</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com">API</a> should always be left open in your browser for quick reference. And although in desperate need of gardening, the <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com">Rails Wiki</a> is also a great place to find community generated tips, howto&#8217;s and tutorials.</p>

<h3>Other Valuable Resources</h3>


<p>So what else is there? Just take a look at these worthy reads:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://peepcode.com/">Peepcode</a> - Although not strictly a read, the Peepcode screencasts are a great watch.</li>
    <li><a href="http://blog.invisible.ch/files/rails-reference-1.1.html">InVisible Ruby On Rails Reference</a> - A little outdated, but a great quick reference site.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.irintech.com/x1/blogarchive.php?id=463">Ruby Cheat Sheet</a> - Similar to the above, but for Ruby.</li>
    <li><a href="http://ruby-lang.org">The official Ruby site</a> - Has some good starting tutorials, aswell as the Ruby API.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.railsweenie.com/">Rails Weenie</a> - A forum that contains helpful tips and advise.</li>
</ul>




<h3>Ruby and Rails Blogs</h3>


<p>Often the best blogs are written by the members of the Rail core team, but I also found some others:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/">LoudThinking</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://errtheblog.com/">err.the_blog</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://blog.caboo.se/">:caboose</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/">Riding Rails</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://nubyonrails.com/">Nuby on Rails</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://weblog.techno-weenie.net/">Techno Weenie</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/">Redhanded</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.codyfauser.com/">Cody Fauser</a></li>
</ul>




<h3>Go Forth and roll</h3>


<p>Well I think that just about covers everything I used during my week of rolling with Rails. I hope you will find it helpful. Enjoy and let me know if you have found any great RoR resources.</p>

      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the things that I like so much about the Ruby on Rails framework are its RJS templates. I will let the Rails API tell you more:</p>

<blockquote>Unlike conventional templates which are used to render the results of an action, these templates generate instructions on how to modify an already rendered page. This makes it easy to modify multiple elements on your page in one declarative Ajax response. Actions with these templates are called in the background with Ajax and make updates to the page where the request originated from.</blockquote>


<p>So when you make an Ajax call, you can return pure javascript and use that to modify the page that you are on. For example, you could create an RJS template that simply hides an element on the page you are on.</p>

<p>Replicating RJS templates in <a href="http://cakephp.org">CakePHP</a> is surprisingly easy with the <a href="http://bakery.cakephp.org/articles/view/197">all new 1.2 version</a> of the rapid application development framework for PHP.</p>

<p>All you gotta do is add the following function in your AppController:</p>

<pre><code>function beforeRender()
{
    if (isset($this-&gt;params['url']['ext']) &amp;&amp; $this-&gt;params['url']['ext'] == 'js')
    {
        $this-&gt;layout = false;
        header("Content-type: text/javascript");
    }
}
</code></pre>


<p>What that does is take advantage of the new <a href="http://joelmoss.info/switchboard/blog/2125:New_in_Cake_URL_Extensions">URL Extensions</a> introduced in CakePHP 1.2. It looks to see if you are using a JS extension. If you are, it disables the layout and sets the pages Content-Type to &#8221;<em>text/javascript</em>&#8221;.</p>

<p>Now when you call http://MyCakeApp/controller/action.js it will return your Javascript template from /app/views/controller/js/action.ctp. This view template should contain only javascript, but of course you can still use PHP and your Helpers in there. It will also only work if you are using the Ajax functionality of the <a href="http://prototype.conio.net/">Prototype javascript library</a>.</p>

<p>So the following could be the entire contents of your JS view:</p>

<pre><code>
  new Effect.Highlight('');
  Field.activate('');

  $('loading-text').update('Login Successful.');
  window.location.href = '/';
</code></pre>


<p>As you can see, you don&#8217;t need to use any SCRIPT tags. Just place the javascript directly into it.</p>

<p>Works a treat and does exactly what Rails RJS templates do. Please do try it and play with it some more, as you won&#8217;t really know its full potential until you do.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hi all and happy new year. Hope you all had a great Christmas.</p>

<p>I am hoping to increase my activity on this blog in the next year and post more tips and articles as I discover them. Let me start of with the first of a number of articles introducing whats new and changed in <a href="http://bakery.cakephp.org/articles/view/197">CakePHP 1.2</a>.</p>

<p>I have found URL Extensions to be extremely valuable when serving differing types of content in my Cake apps. They provide an extremely easy way to serve separate templates/views depending on what you want to see.</p>

<p>Usually when you call <em>http://MyCakeApp/controller/action</em> the actions view would be pulled from the <em>/app/views/controller/action.ctp</em> template file. (The .ctp extension is the new standard extension used for view templates in Cake.) Which is fine if all you ever want to do is serve the same type of content all day.</p>

<p>But what happens if you would like to display that same view in XML or RSS? I know there are other ways of doing this, but the use of URL Extensions is by far the easiest and quickest.</p>

<p>So all you would do is call <em>http://MyCakeApp/controller/action.xml</em>. And instead of <em>/app/views/controller/action.ctp</em> being rendered, it would look for your view template at <em>/app/views/controller/xml/action.ctp</em>.</p>

<p>If you want to do something different when the XML view is called, you can use</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;params['url']['ext']
</code></pre>


<p>The above will output the extension name. For example, if <em>http://MyCakeApp/controller/action.xml</em> were called, the above would equal &#8221;<em>xml</em>&#8221;.</p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just found a great little <a href="http://rsthree.com/2006/12/02/ruby-for-php-programmers/">article</a> that introduces Ruby to PHP programmers.</p>

<blockquote>While Ruby&#8217;s documentation is at a point now where beginners can start digging in and learning quite rapidly, there appears to be a learning curve with developers coming from other languages. Ruby is a language that took the best ideas from many languages such as Perl, Lisp, Smalltalk, and others, and while some syntax is immediately familiar to a PHP developer, the more you really unlock the power of the language, the less it looks like anything we&#8217;ve seen before.</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s definately <a href="http://rsthree.com/2006/12/02/ruby-for-php-programmers/">worth a read</a>.</p>
