  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a reprint of an announcement made a few minutes ago at <a href="http://codaset.com">Codaset.com</a>&#8230;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am very pleased to announce that Codaset has ended it&#8217;s private beta phase, and is now open to all. The beta tag is still in place, so the site is effectively in public beta. This means that no invite is needed to register and create an account. Anyone can create projects, and anyone can take part in any activity on the site.</p>

<p>Along with this announcement, also brings with it a few bug fixes, and minor improvements. Nothing huge, but you should find that browsing the site in Safari is much improved, and several styling bugs have been fixed. I also added URL slugs to milestones, which means your Milestones look prettier and are more familiar to browse.</p>

<p>So I am hoping that with this announcement and release, we will start to see an increase in the number of registered users, and active users. And of course, Codaset is one step closer to a final release. So if there are any features you want to see in the final release; and if there is not already a ticket for it, please create one now. If there is a ticket already created for your requested feature, please vote it up. Voting for tickets is the best way for me to see what you want.</p>

<p>You can see Codaset&#8217;s tickets at <a href="http://codaset.com/tickets">http://codaset.com/tickets</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve found myself creating a number of new Rails apps as of late, and found it very cumbersome to set each one up with my favoured list of gems and plugins. So I created my own Rails Template.</p>
<p>Rails templates are single ruby scripts which contain a few commands that help you setup any new Rails app in a snap. So you can specify a list of Gems to have installed and part of your environment.rb, and also install a bunch of plugins, amongst other things.</p>
<p>You should take a look at <a href="http://m.onkey.org/2008/12/4/rails-templates">Pratik Naik&#8217;s blog post</a> for full details on what Rails templates can do.</p>
<p>So my default Rails template is called <a href="http://codaset.com/joelmoss/railings">Railings</a>, and is available now on <a href="http://codaset.com/joelmoss/railings">Codaset</a>. It is sure to grow by the day, but for now, this is what you get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>jQuery 1.3.2</li>
  <li>Blueprint CSS Framework</li>
  <li>Initializes as a Git repo and creates .gitignore</li>
  <li>Creates staging environment</li>
  <li>Creates application layout</li>
  <li>A default database.yml, and a modified database.example.yml which is ued with the &#8216;Wheres my database.yml dude?&#8217; rake task</li>
  <li>Creates Vlad the Deployer deploy.rb config file</li>
  <li>Time formats initializer</li>
  <li>The following gems:
    <ul>
      <li>thoughtbot-factory_girl</li>
      <li>rubyist-aasm</li>
      <li>mislav-will_paginate</li>
      <li>hpricot</li>
      <li>RedCloth</li>
      <li>emk-safe_erb</li>
      <li>settingslogic</li>
      <li>vlad</li>
      <li>vlad-git</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The following plugins setup as Git submodules:
    <ul>
      <li>limerick_rake</li>
      <li>mile_marker</li>
      <li>squirrel</li>
      <li>rspec</li>
      <li>rspec-rails</li>
      <li>exception_notifier</li>
      <li>monkey-magic</li>
      <li>gravatar</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So the next time you start a new rails app, run this command and you will have the world at your fingertips:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
  I was just browsing through my tweets and came across this little gem as put forward my Nate Abele; he of CakePHP lead developer fame&#8230;
</p>




<p><a href="http://twitter.com/nateabele/statuses/4031886580"><img src="http://twictur.es/i/4031886580.gif" /></a></p>




<p>
  It got me thinking about how I organise my CSS files and code, and as I have been writing a lot of CSS recently when developing <a href="http://codaset.com">Codaset</a>, it made me realise that I have developed a bit of a habit with my own CSS. So I thought I&#8217;d share it all with you.
</p>




<p>
  Over the last year or so, there seems to have been an explosion of CSS frameworks. I suppose it was inevitable really, as it happened with Javascript, so why not CSS. ANd to be honest, I would say that is a good thing, and there are some decent ones out there. But my CSS framework of choice is the excellent <a href="http://www.blueprintcss.org/">Blueprint framework</a>. It&#8217;s a great starting point for all your CSS, and sets some good reset points. It&#8217;s also very lite-weight.
</p>




<p>Before I continue, I just want to say that I will not be telling you how to use Blueprint or indeed, how to write CSS. I use Blueprint&#8217;s grid classes, but again, I won&#8217;t be talking about them. This post is more about how I use a class based system for my CSS.</p>




<p>
  First, if I don&#8217;t already have one, I create a <code>css</code> directory within my public root, the place Blueprint&#8217;s three CSS base files within a sub-directory. I usually call that <code>blueprint</code>. (surprise, surprise). Then I create two files within my <code>css</code> directory called <code>base.css</code> and <code>site.css</code>.
</p>




<p>I&#8217;ve used this structure for this site:</p>




<p><img src="/img/wpuploads/2009/09/one.png" /></p>




<p>
  Pretty obvious so far! Now let me explain what I do with the <code>base.css</code> and <code>site.css</code> file.
</p>




<h3><code>base.css</code></h3>


<p>
  Blueprint has a great set of resets or default styles, but sometimes, I want to overwrite these. I also find myself writing my own default styles, so I put all these within the <code>base.css</code> file. A simple rule of thumb is that only classes are allowed in the <code>base.css</code> file.
</p>


<p>
  Since I started using Blueprint, I&#8217;ve started using it&#8217;s default classes a lot. Classes such as <code>.quiet</code> and <code>.small</code> make it very obvious what I am doing to a particular element. So if I want told make a line of text a little smaller, I can simply wrap the text with a <code>div</code> or a <code>span</code>, and give that <code>div</code> or a <code>span</code> a class of <code>small</code>:
</p>




<div><figure role=code><figcaption><span>html </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
<span class='line'>2</span>
<span class='line'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>&lt;div class="small">
</div><div class='line'>  Here is some text I made a little smaller than the rest.
</div><div class='line'>&lt;/div></div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>




<p>If I wanted it to be colored a little lighter too, then I can add another class to the <code>div</code>:</p>




<div><figure role=code><figcaption><span>html </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
<span class='line'>2</span>
<span class='line'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>&lt;div class="small quiet">
</div><div class='line'>  Here is some text I made a little smaller than the rest, and it's quieter.
</div><div class='line'>&lt;/div></div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>




<p>
  Both those classes and more are all ready to go as part of Blueprint. But I know also want to make this text bold. So I could either give this <code>div</code> an <code>id</code> and create a CSS rule for that new ID like this:
</p>




<div><figure role=code><figcaption><span>css </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
<span class='line'>2</span>
<span class='line'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>#myNewDiv {
</div><div class='line'>  font-weight: bold;
</div><div class='line'>}</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>




<div><figure role=code><figcaption><span>html </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
<span class='line'>2</span>
<span class='line'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>&lt;div class="small quiet" id="myNewDiv">
</div><div class='line'>  Here is some text I made a little smaller than the rest, and it's quieter and now bolded.
</div><div class='line'>&lt;/div></div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>




<p>But that&#8217;s a bit daft, as I am likely to want to make other elements bold. So a new class would be better:</p>




<div><figure role=code><figcaption><span>css </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
<span class='line'>2</span>
<span class='line'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>.bold {
</div><div class='line'>  font-weight: bold;
</div><div class='line'>}</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>




<div><figure role=code><figcaption><span>html </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
<span class='line'>2</span>
<span class='line'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>&lt;div class="small quiet bold">
</div><div class='line'>  Here is some text I made a little smaller than the rest, and it's quieter and now bolded.
</div><div class='line'>&lt;/div></div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>




<p>Now I could easily have given this <code>div</code> an ID instead and done away with all the classes completely. But again, that isn&#8217;t reusable. Another thing I like about the above, is that is very readable and obvious what the classes are doing. It&#8217;s very expressive, and even makes it very easy and fast to style, as all I need to do is assign a few classes, rather than creating any new CSS styles. It&#8217;s like a pick and mix for CSS!</p>




<p>So I&#8217;m now finding that my HTML is full of classes, and I&#8217;m seeing less and less ID&#8217;s. I only tend to use an ID to style an element if that element is more complex, or has specific needs that are not used elsewhere.</p>




<h3>site.css</h3>


<p>So the <code>site.css</code> file is therefore used for element specific styling. So any CSS styles that are defined with an ID, are placed in this file. Not much more to say about that actually.</p>




<p>For more about how it all fits in, check out the source and CSS of this site and of <a href="http://codaset.com"></a>. I would love to know your thoughts and feedback on this. Comment away&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I had a need when developing the beginnings of <a href="http://codaset.com">Codaset</a>, for a nice looking javascript modal/dialog window implementation. I wanted to be able to easily and quickly open up any link in a great looking dialog. I had no shortage of options, as there are tons and tons of jQuery lightbox scripts, or thickbox inspired plugins. But they all seem to want to be the best at absolutely everything.</p>

<p>All I wanted was a simple way to open up a link via ajax into a nice looking dialog window. I didn&#8217;t need to show a slideshow or open up the contents of a div. And I really couldn&#8217;t find one that did just that and did it well.</p>

<p>So like all good developers, <a href="http://codaset.com/joelmoss/codaset-dialog">I created one myself!</a></p>

<p>It&#8217;s been in use on <a href="http://codaset.com"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-390" style="border: 0pt none;" title="Codaset Dialog" src="/img/wpuploads/2009/08/picture-1-300x123.png" alt="Codaset Dialog" width="300" height="123" />Codaset</a> since the private beta launched a month ago, and is running nicely. So I thought it was about time I <a href="http://codaset.com/joelmoss/codaset-dialog">open sourced it and released it to the unsuspecting public</a>. So if you want a sexy, ajax based jQuery dialog window, that is extremely easy to use, does exactly what it says on the tin, then please <a href="http://codaset.com/joelmoss/codaset-dialog">checkout the project now</a> on Codaset, and feel free to <a href="http://codaset.com/joelmoss/codaset-dialog/source">clone and/or fork the source</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yes I know it&#8217;s been quite around here, and yes I know I&#8217;ve only written five of the 10 reasons why Ruby is better than PHP, but I&#8217;ve been really, really busy! And now I have something to show for my busy-ness. Codaset went live about 30 minutes ago, and is now up at http://Codaset.com. You can only get an account if you apply for the beta, but you can still do loads more on the site without one.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a reprint of the official blog post from the new <a href="http://codaset.com/codaset/codaset/blog">Codaset Blog</a>&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Phew!! I did it!</strong> Codaset beta just went live about 10 minutes ago, and if you are reading this, then you are already using the beta.</p>

<p>What started as a genuine need and a desire to create a software development management platform that is actually useful, has turned into what you see right here. Codaset is and will be a tool that I use personally, simply because I am always having to use several different tools or services, to achieve what I need and want. Tools and services such as Github, Trac and Campfire all have pride of place in my browsers bookmarks. They are excellent at what they do, but of course they only do certain things. I want a tool that will gather everything that is good about these three services (and others), and present them to me in an easy, but very useful way.</p>

<p>Right now, Codaset is beta software, which means nothing is complete, and there maybe (and probably will be) bugs. So any bugs you do find should be reported to me as soon as you see them. And what better place to do that, than Codaset itself! <a href="http://codaset.com/codaset/codaset/tickets/new">Create a ticket</a> for any bugs you find, and any features, or enhancements that you think would rock yours - or anyone elses - world.</p>

<p>There are still so many, many more things that will be added during the beta, and I will be blogging about them all right here. You can also keep up to date with Codaset via <a href="http://twitter.com/codaset">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>Even though this is a beta, parts of the site are open to non beta and anonymous users. But you can only create an account, create and fork projects if you have applied for the beta, and have since been approved. So all of you who applied to the beta prior to us going live today, will be receiving an email within the next few days. This will contain instructions on how you can get your account created, and your first project started on Codaset.</p>

<p>Everyone else can still get a beta account, by applying from the homepage at <a href="http://codaset.com">Codaset.com</a>, and I will try my best to get you an account.</p>

<p>Beta testers will receive full and unrestricted access to the entire site during the beta. Once the beta ends (don&#8217;t ask, as I have no idea when that might be) you will continue to receive access to those same features at no cost. However, I cannot guarantee that any new features introduced after the beta ends, will be provided to you at no cost. Hey, but I will definately try.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all I wanna say for now, because I&#8217;m completely knackered. So I&#8217;m off to play a little xbox. Oh yeah, and I suppose it might be a good idea to eat ;)</p>

<p>Thank you to all of you, and please play with it all! Enjoy!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s been a while I know, and I am aware that some of you are chomping at the bit to read reason #5. Apologies for the wait, but some of us have work to do, and a <a href="http://codaset.com">mammoth side project</a> to complete, which by the way, is coming along nicely.</p>




<p>Before I start on reason #5, I want to mention a couple of posts in a similar vein to my series.</p>




<p>Andy Jeffries &#8221;<a href="http://andyjeffries.co.uk/articles/4-reasons-why-ruby-syntax-is-better-than-phps-">4 Reasons why Ruby syntax is better than PHP&#8217;s</a>&#8221; is a straight to the point article all about the strengths of Ruby&#8217;s syntax over PHP. If after reading his post, you still think syntax doesn&#8217;t matter, then you are a lost cause, and beyond help of any kind!</p>




<p>Another post I actually read a while ago, but forgot all about until I was <a href="http://twitter.com/m3nt0r/status/2091044381">pleasantly reminded of</a>, is Bitcetera&#8217;s &#8221;<a href="http://www.bitcetera.com/en/techblog/2009/04/07/10-reasons-why-php-is-still-better-than-ruby-/">10 Reasons why PHP is still better than Ruby</a>&#8221;. Read it carefully all the way through, as it is a great read.</p>




<p>Now, we get to Modules in Ruby, again, a feature that has no direct equivalent in PHP. Modules are very similar to classes, in fact they are written in much the same way:</p>




<div><figure role=code><figcaption><span>ruby </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
<span class='line'>2</span>
<span class='line'>3</span>
<span class='line'>4</span>
<span class='line'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>module Animal
</div><div class='line'>  def name
</div><div class='line'>    "Dog"
</div><div class='line'>  end

<p>So what are they used for? Well, modules are generally used for two purposes; creating namespaces and mixins. I&#8217;m sure (and I hope) that you all know what namespaces are. But you probably have no idea what a mixin is. Well I&#8217;ll get to that in a bit. Let&#8217;s quickly talk about how Ruby uses namespaces.</p>




<p>Let us imagine that we have been charged with cleaning up and re-organizing our code, and we have a lot of it. Normally in PHP you might simply stick this code in a file and include it wherever you need it, but what if you have two methods or constants that are named the same? Some developers have worked around this by separating different class package names with underscores. This solution solves the immediate problem and also works conveniently with autoloading in PHP. It can, however, leave us with some really long class names.</p>




<p>Let&#8217;s imagine we have two classes that define a <code>Document</code> class. In PHP we would probably prefix each class name with the document type:</p>




<div><figure role=code><figcaption><span>php </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
<span class='line'>2</span>
<span class='line'>3</span>
<span class='line'>4</span>
<span class='line'>5</span>
<span class='line'>6</span>
<span class='line'>7</span>
<span class='line'>8</span>
<span class='line'>9</span>
<span class='line'>10</span>
<span class='line'>11</span>
<span class='line'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>class XML_Document {
</div><div class='line'>  public function __construct() {
</div><div class='line'>    print "new xml document\n";
</div><div class='line'>  }
</div><div class='line'>}
</div><div class='line'>class PDF_Document {
</div><div class='line'>  public function __construct() {
</div><div class='line'>    print "new pdf document\n";
</div><div class='line'>  }
</div><div class='line'>}
</div><div class='line'>$xml = new XML_Document; 
</div><div class='line'>$pdf = new PDF_Document;</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>




<p>Ruby would achieve the same thing like this:</p>




<div><figure role=code><figcaption><span>ruby </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
<span class='line'>2</span>
<span class='line'>3</span>
<span class='line'>4</span>
<span class='line'>5</span>
<span class='line'>6</span>
<span class='line'>7</span>
<span class='line'>8</span>
<span class='line'>9</span>
<span class='line'>10</span>
<span class='line'>11</span>
<span class='line'>12</span>
<span class='line'>13</span>
<span class='line'>14</span>
<span class='line'>15</span>
<span class='line'>16</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>module XML 
</div><div class='line'>  class Document 
</div><div class='line'>    def initialize 
</div><div class='line'>      puts 'new xml document' 
</div><div class='line'>    end 
</div><div class='line'>  end 
</div><div class='line'>end 
</div><div class='line'>module PDF 
</div><div class='line'>  class Document 
</div><div class='line'>    def initialize 
</div><div class='line'>      puts 'new pdf document' 
</div><div class='line'>    end 
</div><div class='line'>  end 
</div><div class='line'>end 
</div><div class='line'>xml = XML::Document.new 
</div><div class='line'>pdf = PDF::Document.new</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>




<p>Now I know that the as-yet-to-be-released PHP 5.3 will introduce namespaces, but come on! <a href="http://php.net/manual/language.namespaces.rationale.php">Have you actually seen how PHP namespaces are created and written?!</a> WTF!? Using slashes just looks wrong! Slashes are used in directory paths, and that is where they should stay. And why should I have to declare my namespace at the very top of the file and no where else?</p>




<p>But the best thing about Ruby&#8217;s modules, is the ability to mix them into my classes, as if it was part of the original class code. Think of it as inheritance, but better. Everyone knows that in PHP and Ruby, a class can only inherit from one class at a time. To inherit from another class would involve you having to create a complicated chain of inheritance. Mixins eliminate that need. Just create a class, inherit from another class, and then mixin as many modules as you want.</p>

<p>As you can see, this mechanism is very similar to inheritance in that you can use all of the mixin&#8217;s code.  To use a mixin, simply define a module and then use the include keyword followed by the module&#8217;s name (note I said module; the include keyword has nothing to do with files or libraries like in PHP); from then on the class has access to all of that module&#8217;s constants and methods.</p>




<p>The above example really doesn&#8217;t do mixins justice, but it&#8217;s a very simple example to help demonstrate how they work. Modules are a very versatile tool in Ruby and allow us to extract and share common behavior in objects, and are another reason why Ruby is better than PHP (in my opinion).</p>
