  <div class="entry-content"><p>So <a href="http://codaset.com">Codaset</a> is being written in Ruby on Rails and not CakePHP. A bold decision I think, but a decision backed up by years of sitting on the fence when it came to Ruby and Rails, but also a little controversial, since I have been working with PHP and Cake for a long time now. So I wanted to lay out my reasons for going with Rails for the development of Codaset.</p>




<p>CakePHP is and probably always will be, the best PHP framework out there. I like to think that it has its head screwed on. Of course, that is all about the heads of the core team leading it, but as long as they stay focused on what Cake is there for, then it should stay like that. I continue to use Cake extensively with my day job at <a href="http://shermanstravel.com">ShermansTravel</a>, and will do so for while to come. But, ever since I discovered Ruby on Rails a few years ago, I&#8217;ve been constantly teased by it&#8217;s power - due largely in part by the Ruby language it is written in. A power that PHP simply does not have, and probably never will. Cake is severely limited by PHP, and makes the most of a language that is probably a little inadaquet at times. Unfortunately PHP has bad design decisions written all over it.</p>




<p>In fact, there is not a day goes by, that PHP does not frustrate me with its design. A task completed in PHP, is - most of the time - completed so much more elegantly if done in Ruby. Ruby is just so damn expressive, and actually, very, very natural. PHP is not! I mean, why the hell should I have to write curly braces around every single expression, or wrap things in parenthesis? In Ruby, parentheses are optional in method calls, except to clarify which parameters go to which method calls.</p>




<p>This is PHP:</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>php </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>class Parrot {
</span><span class='line'>  public function say($word) {
</span><span class='line'>    // say it here
</span><span class='line'>  }
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>And this is Ruby:</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>ruby </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>class Parrot
</span><span class='line'>  def say(word)
</span><span class='line'>    # say it here
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>Now isn&#8217;t that so much nicer?</p>




<p>Yes, I know that&#8217;s all about aesthetics, but I like my code to look good. It makes looking at it and working with it, much more pleasant. But also this is just one of the hundreds of reasons why I chose Ruby and Rails. I suppose you could name this post &#8220;Why I chose Rails instead of Cake: <strong>Reason #1</strong>&#8221;.</p>




<p>The bottom line, is that I have played around with Rails for years now, but never took the plunge and wrote an entire - completed - application with it. I started a few times, but then went back to using Cake. But this was because I didn&#8217;t know Ruby well enough, and because of that, it was taking a long time to do something that I could have done much quicker in PHP. But because of all that tinkering, I can confidently say that I now know the basics of Ruby and can quite easily write a Ruby script, or a full Rails app.</p>




<p>So writing Codaset in Rails was the right decision. Every time I open it up in Textmate, I&#8217;m excited by what I see. Everytime I see another Rails plugin or Ruby gem, I want to install it. The thought of developing the next feature of Codaset exites me in ways that PHP almost never has. And because of all that, I&#8217;m learning a new programming language at an incredible rate. Once you get past the learning curve, you really start zooming through any app.</p>




<p>I&#8217;m even considering open sourcing Codaset! I want the world to see what I&#8217;ve done, and how I did it.</p>




<p>Lovin&#8217; it!</p>

Trac is somewhat of a defacto standard for managing software projects, and is what we use at work. Github is what I use for my personal and open source projects; and is also what I wish I could use at work. Both are great at what they do, but in most cases, each does something better than the other.</p>

<p>Trac has a kickass issue tracking system, which is very customisable, and integrates very neatly with Subversion. Unfortunately it&#8217;s not especially user friendly, and doesn&#8217;t support Git. (there is a git plugin, but it&#8217;s alpha code). It&#8217;s also self hosted and written in Python, which means it&#8217;s not the easiest to get up and running.</p>

<p>Github is so hot right now! And for good reason too. It&#8217;s built entirely around the excellent Git, and implements it&#8217;s features all around the ideal&#8217;s of Git. But that&#8217;s about all it does. Only up until recently has it been given an issue tracking system, and to be honest&#8230; that sucks!</p>

<p>So basically, both Trac and Github have their strengths and their weaknesses. But each is missing a part or parts of the other.</p>

<p>So that is why I am creating <a href="http://codaset.com">Codaset</a>. Codaset aims to be all that Trac and Github are good at, in one nice, neat package. It will be based on Git, allowing it to offer great social features, but it will also have a kickass issue tracking</p>

<p>system that will integrate perfectly with your source control.</p>

<p>But I don&#8217;t intend to make this a Github/Trac clone. It&#8217;s gonna be sooo much more&#8230; eventually! Things that you cannot find on any other web based software project management system.</p>

<p>So this was just a little teaser, and an <a href="http://codaset.com">invite</a> for you all to <a href="http://codaset.com">join in the private beta</a>, which I hope to start soon. Take a look over at <a href="http://codaset.com">Codaset.com</a>, and signup now. I&#8217;ll be posting more about what to expect as and when I can. In the meantime, here&#8217;s a quick screen shot to wet your appetite.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had this idea a while ago, and actually implemented it into a Cake project, but it was a bit hacky and required hacking the core. So I didn&#8217;t like it. But today, I had a need for this same functionality, so I had a little think about how I could implement it without hacking the core, and thus was born the <a href="http://codaset.com/joelmoss/cakephp-callbacks">Callbacks plugin</a> for CakePHP.</p>




<p>If any of you have ever used Ruby on Rails, you should be familiar with its callback system. Well, it was this system that I needed.  I just started fleshing out a new Cake app, and needed to run a <em>beforeFilter</em> callback on a couple of specific controller actions. Of course, I could do this:</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>php </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>class MyController extends AppController {
</span><span class='line'>    function beforeFilter() {
</span><span class='line'>        if ($this->params['action'] == 'index' || $this->params['action'] == 'view') {
</span><span class='line'>            # do something here that only the 'index' and 'view' actions need
</span><span class='line'>        }
</span><span class='line'>    }
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>But that&#8217;s just not very elegant, and will get pretty messy the more you do it. So I came up with the Callback plugin, which is basically a simple component that provides some sweetly fine grained control over your callbacks. So now I can do this instead:</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>php </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>class MyController extends AppController {
</span><span class='line'>      var $beforeFilter = array('myCallback');
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>      function _myCallback() {
</span><span class='line'>          # do something here
</span><span class='line'>      }
</span><span class='line'>  }</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>and I can even call several callbacks, each with their own methods:</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>php </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>class MyController extends AppController {
</span><span class='line'>      var $beforeFilter = array('myCallback', 'anotherCallback', 'andAnotherOne');
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>      function _myCallback() {
</span><span class='line'>          # do something here
</span><span class='line'>      }
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>      function _anotherCallback() {
</span><span class='line'>          # do something here
</span><span class='line'>      }
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>      function _andAnotherOne() {
</span><span class='line'>          # do something here
</span><span class='line'>      }</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>Now the above is lovely and all, but it doesn&#8217;t really provide any extra functionality above what Cake already provides. So far, my code just looks cleaner. What I really want to do is only run the <em>anotherCallback</em> when calling the <em>index</em> action. So I change the $beforeFilter param:</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>php </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>class MyController extends AppController {
</span><span class='line'>      var $beforeFilter = array(
</span><span class='line'>          'myCallback',
</span><span class='line'>          'anotherCallback' => array(
</span><span class='line'>              'only' => 'index'
</span><span class='line'>          )
</span><span class='line'>          'andAnotherOne'
</span><span class='line'>      );</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>Much better! I can also specify to run a callback on all actions, except the &#8216;delete&#8217; action:</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>php </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>class MyController extends AppController {
</span><span class='line'>      var $beforeFilter = array(
</span><span class='line'>          'anotherCallback' => array(
</span><span class='line'>              'except' => 'delete'
</span><span class='line'>          )
</span><span class='line'>      );</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>Even better! But still I wanted more!</p>




<p>I wanted to be able to add even more control, and only run a callback if a certain condition is/not met:</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>php </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>class MyController extends AppController {
</span><span class='line'>      var $beforeFilter = array(
</span><span class='line'>          'anotherCallback' => array(
</span><span class='line'>              'if' => 'ifTrue'
</span><span class='line'>          )
</span><span class='line'>      );
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>      function _ifTrue() {
</span><span class='line'>          # do something here and return true for the callback to run
</span><span class='line'>          return true;
</span><span class='line'>      }</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>So the <em>anotherCallback</em> callback will now only run if the <em>_ifTrue</em> method returns true. Lovely!</p>




<p>Right now it supports the three main controller callbacks: beforeFilter, beforeRender and afterFilter. The plan is to provide the same functionality to Models.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s been too long, but here&#8217;s another handful of nibbles for your CakePHP applications and development.</p>

<p><strong>Plugin Server</strong></p>

<p>After some great improved support for re-usable plugins in Cake 1.2, and Gwoo&#8217;s <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">announcement</span> mention at last years CakeFest in Florida; we are now starting to see some evidence of a fabled plugin server. The idea, is that after installing a small Cake shell in your vendors directory, you would be able to install a selection of official and unoffical Cake plugins into your application via the command line. So no need to manually download, unzip and copy files into your plugins directory, as the shell would do it for you. The actual server code is also planning on becoming publicly available, so that we can all host our own CakePHP plugin server.</p>

<p>You can test the first release at <a href="http://plugins.thoughtglade.com">http://plugins.thoughtglade.com</a></p>

<p>I gotta say, that I love this idea, and would really help in spreading the word. Not to mention, make it easier to use Cake and its increasing selection of plugins. I just wish that there would be a similar way to install Cake. There are some great things to be said about systems such as Pear, which would allow you to install the Cake core in a central place on your machine. Then create apps anywhere else on the same machine.</p>

<p><strong>CakePHP 1.2.1</strong></p>

<p>Hot on the heals on the final release of CakePHP 1.2, comes a bug fix and security release. 1.2.1 includes a few bug fixes, but most importantly, fixes a nasty security risk in 1.2. So please <a href="http://cakephp.org/">upgrade</a> as soon as you can.</p>

<p><strong>API Viewer</strong></p>

<p>Up until now, the Cake API left a lot to be desired. But after some frustrations with Doxygen, Core developer Mark Story led the charge to create a Cake based API generator. And man did he do a great job. Check out the new API viewer now at <a href="http://api.cakephp.org">http://api.cakephp.org</a>, or check out and use the code at <a href="http://thechaw.com/api_generator">http://thechaw.com/api_generator</a></p>

<p><strong>DebugKit Moves home</strong></p>

<p>And just a quick reminder that the excellent DebugKit plugin has moved to a new home at The Chaw: <a href="http://thechaw.com/debug_kit">http://thechaw.com/debug_kit</a> - Don&#8217;t leave home without it!</p>

<p><strong>CakePHP Twitter Timeline</strong></p>

<p>This just in, you can now see all the buzz and twitterrings about Cake in a very pleasing way: <a href="http://cakealot.com/cakephp-timeline.html">http://cakealot.com/cakephp-timeline.html</a></p>

<p><strong>BedPosted</strong></p>

<p>And this is just great. A web app which you can use to keep track of your sex life. Haven&#8217;t you always wondered how often you scored this past month, or would like to see a rolling sex history of your life? Well worry no more, coz some bright spark has done just that, and it&#8217;s all done with CakePHP. Check out <a href="http://www.bedposted.com/">BedPost</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a quick one, as I am sure that you have already <a href="http://bakery.cakephp.org/articles/view/the-gift-of-1-2-final">read</a>, but I am extremely pleased to tell you all that CakePHP has been released as a final and stable release. This means no more alpha&#8217;s, beta&#8217;s or release candidates. <a href="http://cakephp.org">Get it while it is hot</a>, as it is very HOT!</p>

<p>Big congrats go to Nate, Gwoo and all the core team. Well done guys! On to 1.3&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This will be a short edition of Cake Nibbles, and I suppose, a bit of a Christmas special.</p>

<p><strong>CakePHP RC4 Released</strong></p>

<p>First up, and the reason for this short, but special edition, is that last nights <a href="http://bakery.cakephp.org/articles/view/rc4-close">announcement</a> of release candidate 4. Even though RC3 was announced as being the last RC before a stable version of CakePHP 1.2, it seems that this new release is actually the last RC. I&#8217;ve mentioned this before, but I really wish that the core team would adhere more to the <em>&#8220;release often, release early&#8221;</em> principle. I really don&#8217;t see how Cake could become any more stable, and unfortunately don&#8217;t think we have any chance of seeing a final stable release by Christmas. But I am encouraged by Nate&#8217;s promise of a final release &#8220;very soon&#8221; after this release. We shall see&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>CakeBattles</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.jamesfairhurst.co.uk">James Fairhurst</a> continues to impress. He just <a href="http://www.jamesfairhurst.co.uk/posts/view/introducing_cakebattles">announced</a> and released another fun application built with Cake.</p>

<blockquote><a href="http://cakebattles.jamesfairhurst.co.uk/">CakeBattles</a> is an online application that allows Contenders to be pitted against each and allows users to vote on who/what would win. Each Contender can be assigned to multiple Tags which are used to create battles with similar Contenders. Each Contender can also have multiple images and these are displayed at random to keep the battles fresh.</blockquote>


<p>I wish I could just write a fun little app, But instead I find myself drawn to very large and complex apps, that I never seem to get finished. Fun to do, but all a little pointless if they never get finished. So hats off to James.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s about it for now. All that remains for me to do now, is to wish and yours a very Merry Christmas and a happy new year. Have a good one!</p>
