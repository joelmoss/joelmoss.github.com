  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just want to apologise to you all and to myself for my lack of activity here. Since I sold HPU, it&#8217;s all been a bit of a blur. And since I started working for ShermansTravel a few months ago, its been even more of a blur. I just haven&#8217;t had the time for any extra curricular activities.</p>

<p>But in terms of my CakePHP development - especially with 1.2 - I think that will be a good thing. I am reluctant to code anything more in 1.2 until I see some form of beta release. And I honestly don&#8217;t see that happenning anytime soon. Cake 1.2 has been in development for too long, and I think PHPNut and co. need to put a feature freeze on it and work on what they have. Otherwise 1.2 will never see the light of day.</p>

<p>Since I started my new job, I have realised that using 1.2 in production and mission critical environments just isn&#8217;t an option. But I really don&#8217;t want to waste my time coding in 1.1, as the changes between the two version are just too huge. For example, there is a real need for me and my team to migrate ST&#8217;s QuickSearch product onto Cake, but I am very reluctant to start now, as it would mean having to do it in 1.1. And if I did so, it would mean a lot of code changes when 1.2 becomes production ready.</p>

<p>So I suppose this is heartened plea to the CakePHP core dev team. Please put aside any new features, leave them till the next release, and just finish off what you have already got. Lets get 1.2 out to the masses. Besides helping me out, it would also do wonders for the CakePHP community and its uptake. And it would inspire me to start writing more addons and articles about it.</p>

<p>Cake Migrations is not forgotten, even though it looks like Migrations will be included in 1.2, albeit completely different to my implementation. I am still commited to making DB migrations easier and faster than ever to use and run. And I fully expect my Migrations to be exactly that, even when the official migrations appear in core.</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s the western front. How about the east side and Tooum / Switchboard? Well, again that has been neglected somewhat, although I have made one solid decision. And that is to rewrite it all in Ruby on Rails. I really think that it will do wonders for the the service and really help me in my learning of Ruby and the framework. Every time I see a blog post about some aspect of Rails, just stirs up the fire in my belly to master Ruby and Rails. So hopefully, I can spend a little spare time pushing out Tooum v2.0.</p>

<p>One or two more ideas have also popped into my head over the last few months. One of which I want to follow up on as soon as possible. Fans of CakePHP and Ruby on Rails should love it.</p>

<p>Watch this space and enjoy ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just watched <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com/2007/8/24/rails-vs-php">Ruby on Rails Commercial #6</a> from the guys at <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com">RailsEnvy</a> today, and I gotta admit, it really does come very close to the truth.</p>

<p>A lot of the features in CakePHP have been influenced by those features already found in Rails, r simply copied from Rails. Of course I am not part of the Cake core team, so I don&#8217;t know how or why such features were included. But you know what? Does it really matter? DHH and Rails should really be very flattered. Why reinvent the wheel, when someone has already done it for you?</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Haven&#8217;t done one of these in a while, probably because there haven&#8217;t been many feature changes in the 1.2 branch. But the last month or so have seen a few small feature changes that I think could be very useful.</p>

<h4>No more global constants</h4>


<p>The first of these changes is the transitioning of the configuration away from global constants. I am sure you are fully aware of the plethora of constants within the core.php file. Well, the final release of 1.2 will see these replaced with singleton calls to the Configure class.</p>

<p>So instead of</p>

<pre><code>define('DEBUG', 2);</code></pre>


<p>you get&#8230;</p>

<pre><code>Configure::write('debug', 2);</code></pre>


<p>Good move, as any sort of globals can cause issues.</p>

<h4>RESTful Routes</h4>


<p>Now this is one feature that I really loved when I played with Ruby on Rails. I really got to love the simplicity and the &#8216;that makes sense&#8217; mentality of RESTful routes. If you have no idea what I am on about, I highly recommend that you take a little time to watch and listen to <a href="http://www.scribemedia.org/2006/07/09/dhh/">DHH&#8217;s keynote presentation</a> at last years RailsConf.</p>

<p>Anyway, at the end of July, I noticed <a href="https://trac.cakephp.org/changeset/5454">changeset 5454</a>, which made changes to the Router. More importantly it added support for RESTful routes, which take advantage of the hidden beauty of the HTTP GET, POST, PUT and DELETE verbs.</p>

<p>I have yet to play with this fully, so not 100% sure of how it works, but I would like to thank the core team for including it. And I hope to write more about it in a future article.</p>

<h4>Prefixed Routing</h4>


<p>A recent changeset also introduced prefix based routing. Which lets you specify a prefix in any route, which is then prepended to the action called.</p>

<p>For example, with the prefix variable set to admin in your route, you could access the following URL:</p>

<pre><code>/admin/posts/create</code></pre>


<p>which would then call the admin_create action within the posts controller.</p>

<p>So we still have some new things to look forward to in 1.2. In fact I am beginning to think that CakePHP 1.2 would be best refered to as CakePHP 2.0.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

      <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/blog/2007/07/29/migrations-v33/">Migrations v3.3</a></h1>
    
    
      <p class="meta">

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just pushed out a pretty good update of Migrations today. Version 3.3 includes some cool updates that make migrations even easier and even faster to use. (didn&#8217;t I say that last time?)</p>

<p>The biggest change is the introduction of migration file generation within the Migrate shell itself. This functionality used to be included within the accompanying Generator shell. But I decided that this was a little unnecessary, so as soon as Fixtures is updated (later this week) the Generator shell will be phased out and deprecated.</p>

<p>I also cleaned up the code a little and documented some more. There is now a help command that will help you with how to use it.</p>

<p>So, you can get v3.3 of Migrate.php from <a href="http://cakeforge.org/snippet/detail.php?type=snippet&amp;id=165">CakeForge</a>.</p>

<p>Here are the other changes:</p>

<ul>
    <li>[*] a little cleanup and refactoring, including more detailed and friendly output</li>
    <li>[*] added more comments and documentation</li>
    <li>[+] migration file numbering now uses three digits starting from 001</li>
    <li>[+] added new &#8216;version&#8217; and &#8216;v&#8217; method as an alternative to the &#8216;-v&#8217; switch</li>
    <li>[+] can now generate migration files as generator shell is now deprecated.</li>
    <li>[+] can now run all migrations from the current version down, up to the latest version</li>
    <li>[+] can now use shortened YAML when specifying column properties</li>
</ul>


<p>Examples:</p>

<pre><code>name: [string, 32, not_null]  # will create a string(varchar) column with length 32 and not null
- no_dates   # no date columns will be created (don't forget the hyphen)
- [no_dates, no_id]   # no date or ID columns will be created (don't forget the hyphen)
</code></pre>


<p>Enjoy one and all!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few months ago, I discovered that the CakePHP core team had decided to include migrations into the core of the framework. Of course, I was quite chuffed that Nut and his colleagues found the idea and my code good enough to include in the actual framework. However, I soon discovered that they had no intention of using my code and were going it alone to produce their own version of Migrations. I was a bit gutted, but so be it.</p>

<p>Now finally the first traces of the CakePHP migrations shell have appeared on the <a href="https://trac.cakephp.org/changeset/5443">SVN sandbox</a>. It&#8217;s early days, but so far so not so good. As already expected, there is no sign of YAML in the migration files. It seems that the core team don&#8217;t like YAML, and so are sticking with bog standard PHP arrays. So instead of specifying your migration instructions in simple, easy to read and fast to type YAML, you will have to write them all in long winded, a pain to type and slow to type arrays!</p>

<p><strong>WHY?</strong></p>

<p>Now I know I have never really been in line with PHPNut&#8217;s thinking and the ideals of the CakePHP project, but why do they feel the need to complicate things too much. As soon as the sandbox code is more fleshed out, I will show you what I mean. But I guarentee that YAML is faster and easier to use than arrays? Correct me if I am wrong, but a framework, by nature is supposed to make developing applications easier and faster.</p>

<p>So I am excited to see migrations finally appearing in the core, but why are they making it harder to use?</p>

<p>Let me put it this way, don&#8217;t expect my migrations to disappear any time soon. I am still planning to develop and support them for as long as I feel they are needed, which certainly looks that way if arrays are used in the official migrations code.</p>

<p>PS: sorry for my rant, but don&#8217;t you agree with me?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well it finally happened and it is loooong overdue. as <a href="http://www.php.net/index.php#2007-07-13-1">announced</a> on the the official PHP site, PHP4 will reach its end of life n 2007-12-31. After which no more work will be done on PHP4, except critical security fixes.</p>

<p>So maybe we can start to see PHPNut and crew start to think about pushing CakePHP v2 with PHP5 only support?!</p>
