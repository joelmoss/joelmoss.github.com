title: Is CakePHP, Ruby on Rails' biggest fan?
categories: articles
---
<p>Just watched <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com/2007/8/24/rails-vs-php">Ruby on Rails Commercial #6</a> from the guys at <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com">RailsEnvy</a> today, and I gotta admit, it really does come very close to the truth.</p>

<p>A lot of the features in CakePHP have been influenced by those features already found in Rails, r simply copied from Rails. Of course I am not part of the Cake core team, so I don't know how or why such features were included. But you know what? Does it really matter? DHH and Rails should really be very flattered. Why reinvent the wheel, when someone has already done it for you?</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>
