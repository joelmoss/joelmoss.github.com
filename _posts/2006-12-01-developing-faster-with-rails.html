title: Developing faster with Rails?
categories: articles
---
<p>I've lost track of the numerous amount of times that I have sat down and started to learn and build a web application with Ruby on Rails. I get excited about it just by reading any mention of the framework in a blog or tutorial and decide - again - that I want to learn it. But then I give up after a few hours because I figure that PHP can do the same thing, and I don't even have to learn a new language.</p>

<p>But I still keep coming back to the same question; <strong>is developing a web app in Rails faster that developing the same thing in PHP?</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.thefutureoftheweb.com">Jesse Skinner</a> seems to think it is. He just switched from PHP and wrote an <a href="http://www.thefutureoftheweb.com/blog/2006/11/switch-from-php-to-ruby-on-rails">article on his blog about his experience</a>.</p>

<blockquote>So I did it. I've been coding in Rails since the start of the month, and it's been a great time. Sure, there was a learning curve. It took me some time to figure out how to do the simplest of things. But I read through the book, I experimented, I searched the web for answers, and now I'm cruising. I'm about 80% as good in Rails as I am in PHP, except <strong>with Rails everything takes half the time so in the end it's actually faster.</strong></blockquote>

<p>What struck me most about the above quote, is the part in bold. Is it really faster to work with? Can't I achieve the same thing with PHP and a <a href="http://cakephp.org">good framework</a>?</p>

<p>I have read a lot of info on Rails and what its advantages are, but I still don't know these answers. So can anyone help me out here?</p>

<p>Shall I switch to Rails and why?</p>
