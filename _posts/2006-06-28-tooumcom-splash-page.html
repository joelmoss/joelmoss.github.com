<p>The first tool for <a href="http://tooum.com/">Tooum</a> is coming along very nicely and we should be ready to start an early public beta test of Switchboard next month. The plan is to replace the current HPU forums and blog with Switchboard, so as to allow real world usage and testing.</p>

<p>Until then, I have put up a simple splash page&nbsp;at <a href="http://tooum.com/">toom.com</a>&nbsp;so you can register your interest.</p>

<p>I will post more info about Switchboard very soon, including some screenshots.</p>
