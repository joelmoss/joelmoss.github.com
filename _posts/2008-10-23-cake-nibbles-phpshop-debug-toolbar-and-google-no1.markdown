Not posted much here recently, so It's great that all of a sudden I have lots of Cake related news and tidbits to share with you all. So hopefully, this will be post number one in a long series of posts covering CakPHP related news and items, entitled Cake Nibbles. Enjoy!

<strong>PHPShop</strong>

The <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/cake-php/browse_thread/thread/6e648259fb875997/99c99b1c28f5788a?show_docid=99c99b1c28f5788a">Google Group revealed some interesting news</a> about a well know open source PHP shopping cart application. It appears that the next version of <a href="http://www.phpshop.org/">PHPShop</a> will be built with CakePHP 1.2. That can be nothing but positive for Cake Land.

<strong>Google No. 1</strong>

Search for "PHP framework" on Google, and guess what? <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=php+framework">Cake is now number one!</a> Oh yes, NUMBER 1! Top of the pops!

<strong>Debug Kit</strong>

Not content with being one of the biggest contributors to the core, Mark Story has created a plugin for CakePHP to help with debugging your applications. <a href="http://github.com/cakephp/debug_kit/tree/master">The Cake DebugKit</a>, which is now publicly available at GitHub, is similar to the extremely helpful Debug Bar that can be found in the Symfony framework. It displays at the top right of your screen, and shows you info about your app, such as load time and SQL queries.

It's early days, but its a great start, and is something that is sorely needed in Cake. I hope to help out with it myself. And the idea of including it in a plugin is genius, and has made me realise how powerful the plugin architecture has become in 1.2

<strong>TextMate Bundle</strong>

Also on GitHub, you can now find another version of the <a href="http://github.com/cakephp/tm_bundle/tree/master">Cake TextMate bundle</a>. But this one is somewhat official, in that it is being maintained by Nate; Cake's Lead Dev.

So thats it for this issue of Cake Nibbles, but I hope to post again soon.

If you have any interesting, or non-interesting news in Cake land, please let me know.
