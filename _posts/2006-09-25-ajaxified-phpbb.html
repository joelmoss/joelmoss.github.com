title: Ajaxified PHPBB

<p>If you have not already seen the fruits of <a href="http://www.jackslocum.com/yui">Jack Slocum's labours</a>, then you should take a look at <a href="http://www.jackslocum.com/forum2/">his impressive attempt</a> at adding a dash of ajax to the popular - but ever so insecure - PHPBB discussion forum software. Using the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">Yahoo User Interface library</a>, it looks and feels just like an email application with the usual three frames of content. Very user friendly. It's even tempting me to introduce a similar layout to Switchboard (albeit an alternative to the current layout.)</p>
