<p><a href="http://www.carsonified.com">Ryan Carson</a> just posted a <a href="http://www.carsonified.com/gtd/improving-your-email-inbox-productivity">small tip</a> on his blog about how he improved his email productivity using <a href="http://www.smileonmymac.com/textexpander/index.html">TextExpander</a> for the Mac.</p>

<p>Using a mix of keywords and/or keyboard shortcuts, TextExpander slashes the time it takes to write an email, especially if it contains lots of content that you repeatedly use. Perfect for writing support emails.</p>

<p>I didn't need to look for for a Windows alternative. The <a href="http://extensions.hesslow.se/extension/4/Quicktext/">QuickText</a> extension for Thunderbird does exactly the same thing.  Just define your shortcut, along with its own keyboard shortcut and keyword. Then write your email - very quickly!</p>
