categories: articles

<p>Well it finally happened and it is loooong overdue. as <a href="http://www.php.net/index.php#2007-07-13-1">announced</a> on the the official PHP site, PHP4 will reach its end of life n 2007-12-31. After which no more work will be done on PHP4, except critical security fixes.</p>

<p>So maybe we can start to see PHPNut and crew start to think about pushing CakePHP v2 with PHP5 only support?!</p>
