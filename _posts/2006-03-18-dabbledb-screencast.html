<p>It&#39;s apps like these that inspire me. <a href="http://dabbledb.com/">DabbleDB</a> is an online database/spreadsheet application that is still in private beta, but recently won best of show at <a href="http://undertheradarblog.com">&#39;Under the Radar: Why Web 2.0 matters&#39;</a> by simply showing this 7 minute screencast demo. Even though I already heard of these guys, this is the first time that I actually get to see what DabbleDB is. And I gotta tell ya - it&#39;s very impressive!</p>

<p>So I&#39;m waiting with baited breath for the public release or beta.</p>
