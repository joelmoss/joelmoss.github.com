title: I finally did it! My own Web Development Podcast
categories: articles
---
<p>I've been threatening to start producing some sort of podcast for ages now. Well I've only gone and bloody done it!</p>

<p>The <a href="http://codaset.com/blog">Codaset Video Podcast</a> has already reached episode 2, and I'me getting great feedback from it. Each week, I will be talking about anything that takes my fancy really, but mostly the topics will be web development and design related.</p>

<p>The first two episodes talk about a few cool jQuery plugins; show of a very cool Ambilight effect video with HTML5; talk about CoffeeScript, and loads of other stuff. The style of the videos are meant to be a little rough at the edges, and I never do more than one take for each one, and perform no editing or cuts. Of course that may change if I see the need, but I want to keep it raw and untamed.</p>

<p>The best place to find the Video Podcasts are on the <a href="http://codaset.com/blog">Codaset blog</a>, but I also publish them on <a href="http://codaset.blip.tv">Blip.TV</a> which offers a few subscription options. And of course you can subscribe to the podcast on <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=361456135 ">iTunes</a>.</p>

<p>To get you started, here is episode 2. Enjoy, and I welcome your thoughts, comments and feedback.</p>
