<p>So...</p>

<p>Hold on a second. Why is it I always start a post with a "So"? I also seem to start my emails and tweets with the word. I think it may have something to do with the way I think. I tend to think of my blog posts, emails and tweets, as an extension or continuation of my thoughts. Which I suppose is no bad thing. But anyway, I digress.</p>

<p>So... (he, he!) Since I started the <a href="http://codaset.blip.tv">Codaset video podcast</a> - which I managed to produce two full episodes of before it stalled a little (Episode 3 is still not done, and I released episode 2 a good 2-3 weeks ago) - I've been thinking about other ways to talk about all the great things that I am constantly discovering on the net. I then started to wonder if there was a blog all about web development, that contained articles about coding, design and tools for web developers. There are plenty of language specific blogs out there, but I have not managed to find a good quality blog that specialises in this one subject, with regular quality articles. Perhaps something akin to TechCrunch (but better) for web developers only. A "DevCrunch" of sorts.</p>

<p>Unless I am mistaken, this sounds like a small gap in the market. So over the next few weeks, I am going to attempt to use this blog as somewhat of a test for this idea. I want to try and write at least one blog post every other day on anything related to web development.</p>

<p>This is quite a big task for me, as I am not the worlds best blogger (as you can tell from the frequency of posts right here), but I think I can do it. I have a large list of links to some great little nuggets of information that I have been saving to talk about in the Codaset video podcast, and the list is growing. So I will be starting with those, and adding to them when I come across anything of interest.</p>

<p>If I can manage this and churn out these regular posts, and you guys like them, then I have other ideas to enhance the thoughts behind this post. I already tweeted about an idea to create some sort of <a href="http://twitter.com/joelmoss/status/11893716277">crowd sourced web development blog</a>, and I really like the idea. Got a bit more to think about how it would work, and how it would be different to sites such as Reddit or Digg, but I like it already, and I think it would be a great way to encourage outside contributions.</p>

<p>So... Onwards and upwards!</p>
