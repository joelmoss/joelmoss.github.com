<p>I just want to apologise to you all and to myself for my lack of activity here. Since I sold HPU, it's all been a bit of a blur. And since I started working for ShermansTravel a few months ago, its been even more of a blur. I just haven't had the time for any extra curricular activities.</p>

<p>But in terms of my CakePHP development - especially with 1.2 - I think that will be a good thing. I am reluctant to code anything more in 1.2 until I see some form of beta release. And I honestly don't see that happenning anytime soon. Cake 1.2 has been in development for too long, and I think PHPNut and co. need to put a feature freeze on it and work on what they have. Otherwise 1.2 will never see the light of day.</p>

<p>Since I started my new job, I have realised that using 1.2 in production and mission critical environments just isn't an option. But I really don't want to waste my time coding in 1.1, as the changes between the two version are just too huge. For example, there is a real need for me and my team to migrate ST's QuickSearch product onto Cake, but I am very reluctant to start now, as it would mean having to do it in 1.1. And if I did so, it would mean a lot of code changes when 1.2 becomes production ready.</p>

<p>So I suppose this is heartened plea to the CakePHP core dev team. Please put aside any new features, leave them till the next release, and just finish off what you have already got. Lets get 1.2 out to the masses. Besides helping me out, it would also do wonders for the CakePHP community and its uptake. And it would inspire me to start writing more addons and articles about it.</p>

<p>Cake Migrations is not forgotten, even though it looks like Migrations will be included in 1.2, albeit completely different to my implementation. I am still committed to making DB migrations easier and faster than ever to use and run. And I fully expect my Migrations to be exactly that, even when the official migrations appear in core.</p>

<p>So that's the western front. How about the east side and Tooum / Switchboard? Well, again that has been neglected somewhat, although I have made one solid decision. And that is to rewrite it all in Ruby on Rails. I really think that it will do wonders for the the service and really help me in my learning of Ruby and the framework. Every time I see a blog post about some aspect of Rails, just stirs up the fire in my belly to master Ruby and Rails. So hopefully, I can spend a little spare time pushing out Tooum v2.0.</p>

<p>One or two more ideas have also popped into my head over the last few months. One of which I want to follow up on as soon as possible. Fans of CakePHP and Ruby on Rails should love it.</p>

<p>Watch this space and enjoy ;)</p>
