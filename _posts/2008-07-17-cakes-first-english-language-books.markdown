It's been a long time coming, but finally we have not one, but two books on the CakePHP framework about to be released.

The first from <a href="http://www.packtpub.com">Packt Publishing</a>, entitled "<a href="http://www.packtpub.com/cakephp-application-development/book">CakePHP Application Development</a>" was recently announced on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/cake-php/browse_thread/thread/b33b85c9792a9d12?hl=en">Cake Google group</a> and is out now.

<blockquote>This book offers step-by-step instructions to learn the CakePHP framework and to quickly develop and deploy web-based applications. It introduces the MVC pattern and coding styles using practical examples. It takes the developer through setting up a CakePHP development and deployment environment, and develops an example application to illustrate all of the techniques you need to write a complete, non-trivial application in PHP. It aims to assist PHP programmers to rapidly develop and deploy well-crafted and robust web-based applications with CakePHP.</blockquote>

The second, which is due to be published this month, is from Apress and is called "Beginning CakePHP: From Novice to Professional".

<blockquote>Leads you from a basic setup of CakePHP to building a couple applications that will highlight CakePHP's functionality and capabilities without delving too deeply into the PHP language, but rather what the CakePHP framework can offer the developer. Targets beginners of CakePHP or web frameworks in general as well as experienced developers with limited exposure to CakePHP. A secondary audience may include developers undecided on adopting CakePHP or business managers trying to assess the value of incorporating CakePHP into their toolbox.</blockquote>

Both books can be purchased and downloaded in PDF format, or in posted to you in paper form.

This is good news for Cake and its community, as good quality books can really help an open source project grow and mature. And of course, it helps those who aren't familar with how the framework works.

So get buying and tell everyone.
