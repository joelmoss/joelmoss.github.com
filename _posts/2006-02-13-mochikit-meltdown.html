<p>During the development of the new PXP hosting system for <a href="http://homepageuniverse.com/ref/joelmoss.info">HomepageUniverse</a>, I have been looking into all the many AJAX and javascript toolkits that are out there. We've tested the usual suspects, including <a href="http://prototype.conio.net/">Prototype</a>, <a href="http://script.aculo.us/">Scriptaculous</a>, <a href="http://moofx.mad4milk.net/">Moo.FX</a> and so on, but this morning I discovered <a href="http://mochikit.com">Mochikit</a>; another lightweight javascript toolkit.</p>

<p>So why I am piping on about yet another AJAX toolkit? Just take a look at the <a href="http://mochikit.com/screencasts/MochiKit_Intro-1.mov">screencast/demo</a> that they have on <a href="http://mochikit.com">their site</a>, and you will see why.</p>
