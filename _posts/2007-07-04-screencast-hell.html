<p>As promised, I am attempting to create a screencast all about Cake migrations, and the joys of using it. But man is it hard! So far I am on attempt number 10 and counting. I just keeping messing up, or forgetting something. But I am determined to get this done and posted here before I go to sleep tonight, so I am prepared for long night.</p>

<p>Stand by Houston...</p>
