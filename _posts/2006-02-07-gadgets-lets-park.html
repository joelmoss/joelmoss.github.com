title: "Gadgets: Lets park"

<p>You may find that I reference the <a href="http://www.stuffmag.co.uk">Stuff Magazine</a> site quite a bit, as it&#39;s just a geeks paradise. Today I saw this very cool gadget that Siemens have developed that finds an empty parking space for you and your car and then even parks it for you.</p>

<blockquote>The system theoretically works like this.

Step one: you&rsquo;re cruising down the street that you need to park in, so you engage the Park Mate and it starts mapping the area.

Step two: when it&rsquo;s found a suitable space it chimes, prompting you to stop the car and wait. Step three: the steering wheel turns of its own accord, moves into the space and stops in an inch-perfect position.

Step four: an intense feeling of smugness and an affectionate tap on the roof for your car.

Unfortunately, this is all a little way off yet &ndash; a recent trial by the <a href="http://news.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/12/26/wpark26.xml">Daily Telegraph</a> resulted in the test car, a BMW Estate, going up the curb twice and nearly shunting the car behind. This was apparently due to cold conditions, and a road-safe version should be with us by 2008.</blockquote>
