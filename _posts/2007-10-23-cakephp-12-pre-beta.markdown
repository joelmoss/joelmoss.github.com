title: CakePHP 1.2 Pre-Beta!?
categories: articles
---
Well <a href="http://joelmoss.info/switchboard/blog/3079:Is_CakePHP_12_Beta_on_the_horizon">I was almost right</a>. Yesterday saw <a href="http://bakery.cakephp.org/articles/view/new-cakephp-releases">another release of CakePHP 1.2</a>, but instead of being another alpha, or even a beta that I was expecting, this release has been marked as a "Pre-Beta". Which really means it's another Alpha release. But, according to the CakePHP site and Nate - one of Cake's core devs ...

<blockquote>At this point we're done adding new features, but we do still have a couple of features which I consider critical to this release that still need a little clean-up.  So, rather than have that hold us up any longer, we decided to do a quick push on the bug fixes and get a release out.</blockquote>

Some of the changes are really nice and much better that before. I am loving the REST support and resources. And you can now see the beginnings of the new 1.2 Manual at <a href="http://tempdocs.cakephp.org/">http://tempdocs.cakephp.org/</a>.

So even though we are not quite at the Beta stage, things are still looking up, and I am hoping to see the first beta released some time in November - but don't quote me on that! Hey, we might even see a release candidate by Christmas!
