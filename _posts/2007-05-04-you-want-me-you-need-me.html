<p>Well, it finally happened. On April 12th, I sold HomepageUniverse and permanently left the web hosting company I started over seven years ago. And you know what? It feels good, and man am I excited?!</p>

<p>So what now?</p>

<p>Well, I got lots of ideas, including some freelance web design and programming work, as well as a few small projects. I also have a few opportunities for employment that I am exploring. I just want to try it all and find out what else is out there.</p>

<p>So with that in mind, I would love to know if I am needed! Do you need an experienced programmer, web designer, business consultant, or just a guy who has been there and bought the t-shirt? Whatever you need ad in whatever capacity you need me in, I would love to talk with you about it, as I am sure that  can help you.</p>

<p>So please get in touch and email me at joel [at] joelmoss [dot] info about anything you want.</p>

<p>Thanks again to all.</p>
