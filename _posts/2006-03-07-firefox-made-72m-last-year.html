<p>Absolutely unbelievable, but apparently, Mozilla, the makers of fast growing Firefox browser made $72 million last year. This was mainly collected from Google and other affiliates. If you search using the default search bix on top right of Firefox, you end up at Google and if you click on any of the sponsored ads, Mozilla get 80% of the ads fees.</p>

<p>So, anyone fancy making a browser and a couple of million?</p>
