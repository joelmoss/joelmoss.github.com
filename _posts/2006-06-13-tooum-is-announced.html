<p>Finally, we&rsquo;re getting somewhere with the development and rebirth of <a href="http://homepagetools.com/">HomepageTools</a>. <a href="http://tooum.com/">Tooum</a> has been announced as HPT&rsquo;s successor and is in active development right now.</p>

<p>Although I have been hailing the might of <a href="http://cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a>, we decided to go with our own framework designed to cater for Tooum. Mainly because Tooum is gonna be pretty complicated, so CakePHP will be used for the first time on other apps.</p>

<p>We have a simple splash page up at <a href="http://tooum.com/">Tooum.com</a>&nbsp;and we are working on our first tool; a forum/blog application codenamed Switchboard, and is&nbsp;the replacement for&nbsp;the aging UltraBoard.</p>

<p>Switchboard is gonna be cool and will be first seen and used as the forum/blog for HomepageUniverse. This will allow us to test it in a real world environment and hopefully gain feedback from real users.</p>

<p>Ooh it&rsquo;s exciting man. I will post again with more as I have it.</p>
