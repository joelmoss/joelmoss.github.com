title: Stable release of CakePHP 1.2 is very, very near
categories: articles
---
As expected since the the changes that were made within the core team a few weeks ago, a final release candidate of CakePHP 1.2 is very imminent. It has just been <a href="http://bakery.cakephp.org/articles/view/cakephp-1-2-stable-coming-soon">announced on the Bakery</a>, that a stable version will be arriving very soon. In fact, I have it on good authority that the first release candidate could be available as early as next week.

There has been a lot more activity on IRC and within the <a href="https://trac.cakephp.org/timeline">Changesets</a> recently, so hats off to all involved, and the <a href="http://book.cakephp.org/">Cake Book</a> is becoming so much better every time I see it.

<em><strong>But</strong></em>, as emphasized in the official announcement on <a href="http://www.debuggable.com/posts/cakephp-1.2-stable-come-and-help:4829b3ac-903c-4f56-94dc-27af4834cda3">Tim and Felix's blog</a>, we need help to squash those remaining bugs. Please join us in the newly created IRC room: #cakephp-dv on freenode.net and offer your assistance however you can.

Here's to a bright future.
