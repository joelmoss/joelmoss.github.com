title: Ruby gets a site lift
categories: articles
---
<p>Even though I decided to stick with PHP for the foreseeable future, I still keep tabs on Ruby and Rails. This week, the <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">official Ruby site</a> got itself a much needed facelift. The old site was very dated and... what's the word? ... red! Well they still use red, but they got some blue aswell now.</p>

<p>It looks good and they have included a nice "Getting Started" section for us Ruby newbies.</p>
