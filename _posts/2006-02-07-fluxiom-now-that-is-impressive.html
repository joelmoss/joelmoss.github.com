<p>Just came across <a href="http://www.fluxiom.com">Fluxiom</a>; a new Web2.0 startup currently beta testing and was absolutely amazed at what I saw. Fluxiom is being developed by <a href="http://mir.aculo.us/">Thomas Fuchs</a>, the creator of <a href="http://script.aculo.us/">Scriptaculous</a> and is basically an asset management application using Ajax extensively. That in itself sounds interesting, but what got me excited was the video that you can view on the site. Just <a href="http://fluxiom.com">watch</a> and you will see what I mean.</p>
