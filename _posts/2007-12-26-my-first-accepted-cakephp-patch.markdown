title: My first accepted CakePHP patch
categories: articles
---
A few weeks ago, I submitted a <a href="https://trac.cakephp.org/ticket/3587">patch and test</a> to the CakePHP trac, that added support for multiple resource routes. It was something I needed for my use, but was such an easy fix, I thought I would create a ticket and see if the Cake core team decide to add it to the core.

To be honest, I wasn't hopeful. But yesterday, my patch was added right into the core and is <a href="https://trac.cakephp.org/changeset/6257">now available</a> in the 1.2 branch. Woohoo!

I didn't have any plans to submit any more patches or tickets, but this little piece of news just might spur me on to do more.

Another good thing to come out of this, was my first taste of unit testing. The path I submitted, also included a test case which worked perfectly. I am pretty sure that the inclusion of that test, helped my patch become included in the core.

So I think I feel more testing coming along. I might even contemplate writing a patch for migrations. But I wouldn't expect that to appear in the core, as I have been told that the core team don't like YAML.

But ya never know ;)
