<p>Well I suppose you could say that HomepageTools officially became Tooum today. We just replaced the main HPT site with the new Tooum splash page readying for the public beta launch later this month. I have made sure that existing HPT users know what is going on. So if you go to <a href="http://homepagetools.com">http://homepagetools.com</a>, you will now see the Tooum splash page, but will also see a short notice about what has happened to HPT.</p>

<p>The official Tooum Switchboard should also be put online next week, so you can try it out all you want. It will also contain all news and discussions about Tooum and Switchboard. So you won&rsquo;t see many more posts in this Blog about Tooum.</p>

<p>Until then, don&rsquo;t forget to check out the new <a href="http://switchboard.homepageuniverse.com/">HomepageUniverse Community</a> which uses a very early preview version of Switchboard.</p>
