<p>With thanks to kabturek and dhofset in Cake IRC, we discovered a few bugs in Migrations. So I have updated it and released version 2.0.2. You can download it from <a href="http://homepageuniverse.com/migrations.zip">HomepageUniverse</a></p>

<p>Please play around. Oh and don't forget to check out the <a href="http://joelmoss.info/switchboard/blog/1997:The_Joy_of_Cake_Migrations__my_first_tutorial">tutorial</a>.</p>
