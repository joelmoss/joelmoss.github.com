It's been too long, but here's another handful of nibbles for your CakePHP applications and development.

<strong>Plugin Server</strong>

After some great improved support for re-usable plugins in Cake 1.2, and Gwoo's <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">announcement</span> mention at last years CakeFest in Florida; we are now starting to see some evidence of a fabled plugin server. The idea, is that after installing a small Cake shell in your vendors directory, you would be able to install a selection of official and unoffical Cake plugins into your application via the command line. So no need to manually download, unzip and copy files into your plugins directory, as the shell would do it for you. The actual server code is also planning on becoming publicly available, so that we can all host our own CakePHP plugin server.

You can test the first release at <a href="http://plugins.thoughtglade.com">http://plugins.thoughtglade.com</a>

I gotta say, that I love this idea, and would really help in spreading the word. Not to mention, make it easier to use Cake and its increasing selection of plugins. I just wish that there would be a similar way to install Cake. There are some great things to be said about systems such as Pear, which would allow you to install the Cake core in a central place on your machine. Then create apps anywhere else on the same machine.

<strong>CakePHP 1.2.1</strong>

Hot on the heals on the final release of CakePHP 1.2, comes a bug fix and security release. 1.2.1 includes a few bug fixes, but most importantly, fixes a nasty security risk in 1.2. So please <a href="http://cakephp.org/">upgrade</a> as soon as you can.

<strong>API Viewer</strong>

Up until now, the Cake API left a lot to be desired. But after some frustrations with Doxygen, Core developer Mark Story led the charge to create a Cake based API generator. And man did he do a great job. Check out the new API viewer now at <a href="http://api.cakephp.org">http://api.cakephp.org</a>, or check out and use the code at <a href="http://thechaw.com/api_generator">http://thechaw.com/api_generator</a>

<strong>DebugKit Moves home</strong>

And just a quick reminder that the excellent DebugKit plugin has moved to a new home at The Chaw: <a href="http://thechaw.com/debug_kit">http://thechaw.com/debug_kit</a> - Don't leave home without it!

<strong>CakePHP Twitter Timeline</strong>

This just in, you can now see all the buzz and twitterrings about Cake in a very pleasing way: <a href="http://cakealot.com/cakephp-timeline.html">http://cakealot.com/cakephp-timeline.html</a>
