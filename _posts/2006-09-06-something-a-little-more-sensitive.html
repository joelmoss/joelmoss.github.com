title: Something a little more sensitive!

<p>Me and my wife have been talking about this idea for a few years now, and since the arrival of number three 18 months ago, we decided that three is in fact the magic number.&nbsp; So last week I went to see my doctor about getting a Vasectomy and ending the onslought of the Moss offspring.</p>

<p>It went quite well, although it was only my GP. He is referring me to the specialist surgeon who apparently spends his every waking hour handling other mens genitals and making the chop!</p>

<p>So I am awaiting that experience with baited breath. However, I found an article by <a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/">Bruce Lawson</a> entitled <a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/index.php/2006/vasectomy">&ldquo;Would a vasectomy make a vas deferens to me?&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;and now I am not so sure;</p>

<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>&ldquo;I can see from your wriggling we&rsquo;ll have to put you out with a General&rdquo;, he said, like a Hibernian Dr Mengele, because I flinched as he rolled each of my testicles between his thumb and forefinger. (Incidentally, the fact that the testes hang outside the body encased in paper-thin skin, rather than guarded by closely interlocking bones forming a special subcutaneous scrotal rib-cage, is, in my opinion, the knock-down argument against the theory of &lsquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_design">Intelligent Design</a>&lsquo;.)</p></blockquote>
