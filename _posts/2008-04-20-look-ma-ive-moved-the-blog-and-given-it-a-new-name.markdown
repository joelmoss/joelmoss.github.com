Well, I got fed up of waiting for myself to finish the new Cake powered Switchboard, and this blog needed a desperate refresh, so I got a copy of Wordpress 2.5 and created all that you see right here.

I've ditched the joelmoss.info domain (it was a bit boring after all) and now use something a little fresher; "Developed With Style". And as you can see, everything is new and ties in nicely with my new company name; "Develop With Style". I even created a nice little temporary splash page on that domain. You can see it at <a title="developwithstyle.com" href="http://developwithstyle.com">developwithstyle.com.</a>

Check out the links at the top of the page. I have created a <a href="http://developingwithstyle.com/scraps">Scraps</a> section, which will include some nice little distraction from your daily lives. They're basically tiny little posts that don't really need an entire article devoted to them.

I've also included my <a href="http://del.icio.us/joelmoss" target="_blank">Del.icio.us links</a> directly into the sidebar and a link that goes directly to them. They need a good cleanup and refreshing, but you should find some interesting and useful links in there.

FYI: The old feed should still work, as it will simply redirect to the new FeedBurner powered feed. If you haven't already, <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/DevelopingWithStyle">please subscribe now</a>.

I plan to use this new blog as a bit of a sandbox; a way of playing with new ideas and code, so expect to see plenty of changes. I also plan on blogging more, so what this space.

So for now, that is all, although I hope to post a few more times before I leave for my holidays on friday. And stand by for details on a new CakePHP project.
