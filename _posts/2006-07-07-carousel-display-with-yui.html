<p>Yet another fine example of the <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=2&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.yahoo.com%2Fyui%2F&amp;ei=qlauRKyHJ6GEiALTsuHoBg&amp;sig2=82DBIb3xHcssLfWrIhTPkw">Yahoo User Interface</a> (YUI) has been created by <a href="http://billwscott.com/">Bill W. Scott</a>. Knocked out in a weekend, the <a href="http://billwscott.com/carousel/">Carousel Component</a> is a scroller than can display selected pictures in a carousel type way. It can be presented vertically or horizontally and can be served client or server side.</p>

<p>Even though I have decided to use Prototype and Scriptaculous for Tooum, seeing things like this keeps tempting me to the other side.</p>
