<p>Just discovered a great resource for bakers of CakePHP. The <a href="http://thinkingphp.org/cakenews/">CakeNews</a> site summaries subjects from the latest and greatest sources of news about the CakePHP framework. These include feeds from numerous blogs aswell as the Cake Google Group. It's a required site for those who use Cake.</p>
