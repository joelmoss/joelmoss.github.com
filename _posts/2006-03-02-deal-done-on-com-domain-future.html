<p>Not good news:</p>

<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4763606.stm">BBC NEWS Technology Deal done on .com domain future</a>: &quot;The deal gives US firm Verisign control of .com until 2012 and lets it raise prices in at least four of the next six years.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s all politics, but I say give control of ICANN to the UN.</p>
