<p>Want a quick and easy way of creating a 1-3 columned CSS page? Then take a look at the CSS Generator over at <a href="http://www.positioniseverything.net/articles/pie-maker/pagemaker_form.php">Position Is Everything</a>. Simply enter your chosen values in each of the form fields and click submit. Up pops a new window with a full CSS only page based on what you entered. It will even insert comments directly into the CSS o explain to you what each part does. Nice!
