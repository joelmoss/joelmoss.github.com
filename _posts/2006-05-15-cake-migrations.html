<p>Ok, so I do sometimes go headfirst into the deep stuff at times, but it's not always bad! Before I even created a working app with <a href="http://cakephp.org">CakePHP</a>, I decided to have a crack at contributing to the project itself. So I created Cake Migrations; a direct port of <a href="http://rubyonrails.com">Ruby on Rails</a> database <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/ActiveRecordMigration">migrations</a>.</p>

<p>Migrations are one of the main features I love about RoR, so I wanted to bring them across and use the same functionality with Cake. Migrations are a great way of effectively running a version control system for your database while developing apps in Cake. They really do make a difference, especially when developing as part of a team. To ensure you have the latest database schema, simply run the Migrate CLI script:</p>
<blockquote>php migrate.php</blockquote>
<p>and it does it for you. Easy peasy!</p>

<p>You can get the snippet from the <a href="http://cakeforge.org/snippet/detail.php?type=package&amp;id=15">CakeForge package</a>, and I created a quick <a href="http://wiki.cakephp.org/tutorials:cake_migrations">Wiki page</a> to explain how Migrations work.</p>

<p>I hope to create a more informative and permanent page right here in my Blog, so keep watching. Hey and let me know if you use Migrations.</p>
